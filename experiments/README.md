## 1. Impact of Reduction of Context <a id="1"></a>

`\impact-context-reduction`

**Overview**: Comparsion across different methods for demonstration selection selection for In-Context Learning to evaluate the performance in a multi-tasking fo setting for different *k* number of examples when all datast is available and when just the data related to the specific task is available

**Data**: 900 examples in a pool for each task from Instruction Induction dataset that has one and only return + evaluation with 100 examples per task

**Methodology**: TBD


**Main Results**: TBD
