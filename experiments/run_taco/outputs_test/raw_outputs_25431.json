It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.\n\nFor example, triples (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13) and (6, 8, 10) are Pythagorean triples.\n\nHere Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.\n\nKatya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the length of some side of a right triangle.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.\n\nIn case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print  - 1 in the only line.

            "generated_text": "The first and second examples of triples are well-known Pythagorean triples. The third example is a bit less well-known. The fourth example is constructed in the following way. Let a be the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Then a^2 = b^2 + c^2, where b and c are the lengths of the catheti. Since a = 17, then b^2 = c^2 = 288. Since 288 = 144 * 2, then b = 12 * sqrt(2) and c = 16 * sqrt(2). Since the lengths of the sides of the right triangle must be integers, then the problem statement is not satisfied in this case.\n\nLet us consider the fifth example. Let c be the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Then c^2 = b^2 + a^2, where b and a are the lengths of the catheti. Since c = 67, then b^2 = a^2 = 4476. Since 4476 = 2^2 * 3 * 373, then the problem statement is satisfied. \n\n\n\n\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    a = n\n    b = (n * n + 1) // 2\n    c = math.sqrt(b * b - a * a)\n    if c == int(c):\n        print(int(b), int(c))\n    else:\n        a = 2 * n\n        b = (n * n + 1) // 2\n        c = math.sqrt(b * b - a * a)\n        if c == int(c):\n            print(int(b), int(c))\n        else:\n            print(-1)\n```\n\n\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    a = n\n    b = (n * n + 1) // 2\n    c = math.sqrt(b * b - a * a)\n    if c == int(c):\n        print(int(b), int(c))\n    else:\n        a = 2 * n\n        b = (n * n + 1) // 2\n        c = math.sqrt(b * b - a * a)\n        if c == int(c):\n            print(int(b), int(c))\n        else:\n            print(-1)\n```\n\n\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    a = n\n    b = (n * n + 1) // 2\n    c = math.sqrt(b * b - a * a)\n    if c == int(c):\n        print(int(b), int(c))\n    else:\n        a = 2 * n\n        b = (n * n + 1) // 2\n        c = math.sqrt(b * b - a * a)\n        if c == int(c):\n            print(int(b), int(c))\n        else:\n            print(-1)\n```\n\n\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    a = n\n    b = (n * n + 1)"

If n is a cathetus, you can easily get the answer by swapping the values of m and k in the answer.\n\n\nThe problem is reduced to the following problem:\n\nGiven a positive integer n, find two positive integers m and k such that n^2 = m^2 + k^2. It is clear that m < n and k < n.\n\nLet's rewrite the equation as k^2 = n^2 - m^2. It is easy to see that k^2 is odd if and only if n^2 - m^2 is odd.\n\nIf n is odd, then n^2 is odd. Then m^2 is odd, and k^2 is odd. If n is even, then n^2 is even. Then m^2 is odd, and k^2 is odd.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when k is odd. Then k = 2t + 1 for some non-negative integer t. Then k^2 = 4t^2 + 4t + 1. Then n^2 - m^2 = 4t^2 + 4t + 1. We can rewrite this equation as (n + m)(n - m) = 4t(t + 1) + 2t + 1. It is clear that 4t(t + 1) + 2t + 1 is odd, and n + m and n - m are even. Then n + m and n - m are even numbers that have the same parity.\n\nWe can consider the following cases:\n\n1) n + m is even and n - m is even. Then n + m = 2p and n - m = 2q for some non-negative integers p and q. Then n = p + q and m = p - q. Then n^2 - m^2 = (p + q)^2 - (p - q)^2 = 4pq. Then 4pq = 4t(t + 1) + 2t + 1. Then 4p(q - t - 1) = 2t + 1. Then q - t - 1 = 2s + 1 for some non-negative integer s. Then q = t + 2s + 1 and p = t + 1 + s. Then n = p + q = 2t + 2s + 2 and m = p - q = -2s. Then n = 2t + 2s + 2 and m = -2s. Then k = n^2 - m^2 = 4t^2 + 4t + 1. Then k = 4t^2 + 4t + 1 and k = 2t + 1. Then t = 1 and s = 0. Then n = 4 and m = 0. Then k = n^2 - m^2 = 16 - 0 = 16, but k = 2t + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3. This is a contradiction.\n\n2"
