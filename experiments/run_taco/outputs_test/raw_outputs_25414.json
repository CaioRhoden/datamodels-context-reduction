We can use a segment tree to store the count of unique elements in each segment. We can then use a prefix sum array to calculate the expected value of the number of unique elements in each segment.\n\nThe segment tree can be built in O(n log n) time, and the prefix sum array can be built in O(n) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n log n + n) = O(n log n).\n\nHere is a sample code in C++ to solve the problem:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int N = 1000000;\nconst int M = 1000000;\n\nlong long sum[N + 1];\nint cnt[N + 1];\nint a[N + 1];\nint n;\n\nint main() {\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(nullptr);\n\n    cin >> n;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        cin >> a[i];\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        cnt[a[i]]++;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + cnt[i];\n    }\n\n    double ans = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        int l = i, r = i;\n        double p = 1.0 / n;\n        while (l > 1) {\n            l--;\n            p *= 2.0 / n;\n            ans += p * (sum[a[l]] - sum[a[l] - 1]);\n        }\n\n        while (r < n) {\n            r++;\n            p *= 2.0 / n;\n            ans += p * (sum[a[r]] - sum[a[r] - 1]);\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << fixed << setprecision(10) << ans << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code first builds the segment tree and the prefix sum array in O(n log n) time.
