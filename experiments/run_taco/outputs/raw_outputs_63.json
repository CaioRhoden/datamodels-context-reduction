Read the number of points `n` from the input.\n2.  Read the coordinates of the points and store them in a list `points`.\n3.  Count the occurrences of each x and y coordinate using dictionaries `x_counts` and `y_counts`.\n4.  Find the coordinates with a count of 3 (i.e., not on the boundary) using list comprehensions.\n5.  The point not on the boundary is at the intersection of the two coordinates.\n\nThis program assumes that the input points are given in the format `x y`, where `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 50. The program also assumes that the square has four sides parallel to the axes (i.e., `x=0`, `x=2`, `y=0`, and `y=2` in the first example)."}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_outlier(points):\n    # Find the number of points on each side of the square\n    min_x = min(point[0] for point in points)\n    max_x = max(point[0] for point in points)\n    min_y = min(point[1] for point in points)\n    max_y = max(point[1] for point in points)\n\n    # Check all sides of the square\n    for side in [(min_x, min_y), (min_x, max_y), (max_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y)]:\n        points_on_side = [point for point in points if point[0] == side[0] or point[1] == side[1]]\n        # If the number of points on the side is more than n, then the outlier is on the opposite side\n        if len(points_on_side) > len(points) / 2:\n            # Find the outlier by iterating over all points\n            for point in points:\n                if point[0]!= side[0] and point[1]!= side[1]:\n                    return point\n\n# Read the number of points and the points themselves\nn = int(input())\npoints = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4*n + 1)]\n\n# Find and print the outlier\noutlier = find_outlier(points)\nprint(outlier[0], outlier[1])\n```\n\nThis program works by first finding the number of points on each side of the square.

Return the point that lies outside the square.

We first read the number of points `n` and all points from the input.\n2.  We then find the minimum and maximum coordinates on each side of the square by iterating over all points and finding the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates.\n3.  We then iterate over all points again and find the point that is not on the boundary of the square by checking if its coordinates are not equal to the minimum or maximum coordinates on each side of the square.\n4.  Finally, we return the coordinates of this point as the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nYou can use this program to solve the given examples:\n\n*   Example 1:\n\n    ```\nInput:\n2\n0 0\n0 1\n0 2\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n2 0\n2 1\n2 2\n\nOutput:\n1 1\n```\n\n*   Example 2:\n\n    ```\nInput:\n2\n0 0\n0 1\n0 2\n0 3\n1 0\n1 2\n2 0\n2 1\n2 2\n\nOutput:\n0 3\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python program that can solve the given problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_outlier(points):\n    # Separate the points by x-coordinate\n    x_points = {}\n    for point in points:\n        x = point[0]\n        if x not in x_points:\n            x_points[x] = []\n        x_points[x].append(point)\n\n    # Find the side with only one point\n    for x in x_points:\n        if len(x_points[x]) == 1:\n            outlier = x_points[x][0]\n            return outlier\n\n    # If no outlier found, return None\n    return None\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    points = []\n    for _ in range(4*n + 1):\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        points.append((x, y))\n\n    outlier = find_outlier(points)\n    if outlier:\n        print(outlier[0], outlier[1])\n    else:\n        print(\"No outlier found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program works by first grouping the points by their x-coordinates.
