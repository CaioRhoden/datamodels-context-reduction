He also shows them his future using a string $S$ of length $L$ where $S_{i} = 0$ means the $i$-th year will be counted as bad as per the rule books of heaven and $S_{i} = 1$ means the $i$-th year will be counted as good.\n\nAlso, Strange can use his special powers to make Chef end his life earlier than that planned by god, i.e, he can choose some $L'$ ($1\u2264 L'\u2264 L$) and make him live for only $L' $ years. Strange wants Chef to succeed, so if there is any choice of $L'$ that allows Chef to go to heaven, he will do so.\n\nTell whether Chef can go to heaven.\n\n------ Input ------\n\nThe first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases.

If it finds such a substring, Chef can go to heaven.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(T * L^2) where T is the number of test cases and L is the total number of years. This is because in the worst case, we need to check all substrings of S for each test case.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and the count of good years."}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef can_go_to_heaven(L, S):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if Chef can go to heaven.\n\n    Parameters:\n    L (int): The total number of years Chef will live.\n    S (str): A string of length L where S[i] = 0 means the i-th year is bad and S[i] = 1 means the i-th year is good.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if Chef can go to heaven, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the count of good years\n    good_years = 0\n\n    # Count the number of good years\n    for year in S:\n        if year == '1':\n            good_years += 1\n\n    # If the total number of good years is at least half of the total number of years, Chef can go to heaven\n    return good_years >= L // 2\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n\n    # Process each test case\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Get the total number of years and the string of good and bad years\n        L = int(input())\n        S = input().strip()\n\n        # Check if Chef can go to heaven\n        if can_go_to_heaven(L, S):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses a function `can_go_to_heaven` to check if Chef can go to heaven. It iterates over the string `S` and counts the number of good years. If the total number of good years is at least half of the total number of years, the function returns True, indicating that Chef can go to heaven. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\nThe `main` function gets the number of test cases and processes each test case by getting the total number of years and the string of good and bad years, and then checking if Chef can go to heaven using the `can_go_to_heaven` function.
