Since each shuffle involves splitting the deck in half and interweaving the two halves, the deck will return to its original order after every `n/2` shuffles.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that 8 perfect faro shuffles are performed on a deck of 52 playing cards to restore it to its original order, it means that 8 is the least common multiple (LCM) of 52 and 1, because 52 divided by 8 is a whole number. This is a general rule for any deck of cards, not just 52.\n\nSo, to find the number of shuffles it takes to restore a deck of `n` cards, we need to find the LCM of `n` and 1, which is simply `n`. But since we're dividing the deck in half and interweaving the two halves, we need to find the LCM of `n/2` and 1, because we're effectively dividing the deck by 2 each time we shuffle it.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this problem further by using the following property: if `n` is even, then the LCM of `n/2` and 1 is `n/2`. This is because `n/2` is a divisor of `n`, and since `n/2` is already an integer (because `n` is even), it means that `n/2` is a divisor of itself.\n\nSo, to find the number of shuffles it takes to restore a deck of `n` cards, we can simply return `n//2`.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef faro_cycles(deck_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of faro shuffles it takes to restore a deck of n cards to its original order.\n\n    Args:\n        deck_size (int): The size of the deck, which must be an even number between 2 and 2000.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of faro shuffles it takes to restore the deck to its original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(deck_size, int) or deck_size % 2!= 0 or deck_size < 2 or deck_size > 2000:\n        raise ValueError(\"deck_size must be an even integer between 2 and 2000\")\n    return deck_size // 2\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n```python\nprint(faro_cycles(52))  # Output: 26\nprint(faro_cycles(2000))  # Output: 1000\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python function that calculates the number of faro shuffles it takes to restore a deck of `n` cards to its original order:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef faro_cycles(deck_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of faro shuffles it takes to restore a deck of n cards to its original order.\n\n    Args:\n    deck_size (int): The number of cards in the deck.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of faro shuffles it takes to restore the deck.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Since 8 shuffles restore a 52-card deck, we can calculate the number of shuffles required for a deck of n cards\n    # by finding the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n and then dividing it by 52\n    # We use the ceiling function to round up to the nearest whole number, since we can't have a fraction of a shuffle\n    return math.ceil(math.log2(deck_size / 52)) * 8\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(faro_cycles(52))  # Output: 1\nprint(faro_cycles(2000))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis function works by first calculating the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `deck_size / 52`.

Each faro shuffle can be represented as a permutation of the deck, which can be viewed as a product of two transpositions. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, the order of these transpositions is 2 * 3 = 6. Therefore, it takes 6 faro shuffles to restore a deck to its original order.\n\nHowever, since we're given a deck of size n, which is even, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and n/2, which is the number of faro shuffles needed to restore the deck.\n\nHere's a Python function to calculate the number of faro shuffles:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef faro_cycles(deck_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of faro shuffles it takes to restore a deck of n cards to its original order.\n\n    Args:\n        deck_size (int): The size of the deck.

The LCM is the number of faro shuffles needed to restore the deck."}, {"generated_text": "To find the number of faro shuffles required to restore a deck of `n` cards to its original order, we can use the fact that after `k` shuffles, the deck will be restored to its original order when `2^k` is a divisor of `n`. This is because the deck will be restored to its original order when the total number of cards is a power of 2.\n\nWe can use the property of exponents that `a^b % c = (a % c) ^ b` to find the number of shuffles required. Specifically, we want to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`.
