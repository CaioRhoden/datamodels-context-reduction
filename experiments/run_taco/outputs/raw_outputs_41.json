The idea is to maintain two arrays, `easy` and `hard`, where `easy[i]` will store the maximum score that can be obtained by solving `i` easy problems and `hard[i]` will store the maximum score that can be obtained by solving `i` hard problems.\n\nWe start by initializing `easy[0]` and `hard[0]` to 0, as we can't get any score by solving 0 problems.\n\nThen, for each number of easy problems from 1 to `a` and for each number of hard problems from 1 to `b`, we calculate the maximum score that can be obtained by solving `i` easy problems and `j` hard problems.\n\nThe maximum score will be the maximum of the score obtained by solving `i-1` easy problems and `j` hard problems (i.e., `easy[i-1] + x * i`), and the score obtained by solving `i` easy problems and `j-1` hard problems (i.e., `hard[j-1] + y * j`).\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the time constraint. So, we also calculate the total time taken to solve `i` easy problems and `j` hard problems, and update the arrays only if this total time is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumScore(self, n, x, y, a, b, p, q):\n        easy = [0] * (a + 1)\n        hard = [0] * (b + 1)\n        \n        for i in range(1, a + 1):\n            time = i * p\n            if time <= n:\n                easy[i] = easy[i - 1] + x\n            else:\n                break\n        \n        for j in range(1, b + 1):\n            time = j * q\n            if time <= n:\n                hard[j] = hard[j - 1] + y\n            else:\n                break\n        \n        max_score = 0\n        max_easy = 0\n        max_hard = 0\n        \n        for i in range(a + 1):\n            for j in range(b + 1):\n                if easy[i] + hard[j] > max_score and i * p + j * q <= n:\n                    max_score = easy[i] + hard[j]\n                    max_easy = i\n                    max_hard = j\n        \n        return [max_easy, max_hard]\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(a * b) and a space complexity of O(a + b), which meets the requirements."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum score Nikit can get in the given time.
