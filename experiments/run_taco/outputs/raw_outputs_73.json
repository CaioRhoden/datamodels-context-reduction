Then, it initializes a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the expected number of operations until X becomes j after i operations. The base case is when i = 0, in which case dp[0][0] = 0 and dp[0][j] = 1 for all j!= 0. For each i from 1 to n, it calculates dp[i][j] as the expected number of operations until X becomes j after i operations. This is calculated as (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j ^ (1 << i - 1)] + A[j ^ (1 << i - 1)] / sum_A) % mod * inv_mod(1 - A[j ^ (1 << i - 1)] / sum_A) % mod. This is because the expected number of operations until X becomes j after i operations is the expected number of operations until X becomes j after i - 1 operations plus the expected number of operations until X becomes j ^ (1 << i - 1) after i - 1 operations plus 1, weighted by the probability of X becoming j ^ (1 << i - 1) after i - 1 operations.
