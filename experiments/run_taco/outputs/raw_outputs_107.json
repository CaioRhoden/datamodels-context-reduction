The score of each row/column is calculated by iterating over each element in the row/column, and multiplying the element with the corresponding binary digit (i.e., `1 << (n - j - 1)` for rows and `1 << (m - i - 1)` for columns).\n\nThe program reads the input from the user using `input()` function, and prints the maximum score by calling `max_score(matrix)` function.\n\nNote that this program has a time complexity of O(m \\* n \\* m \\* n), where m and n are the dimensions of the input matrix.

The `flip_matrix` function flips the matrix by toggling all elements.\n2.  It then identifies the columns and rows with the most 1s and flips them.\n3.  The `calculate_score` function calculates the score by converting each row to a binary number and summing them up.\n4.  In the `main` function, we try all possible combinations of flips for the columns, flip the matrix, and then calculate the score. We keep track of the maximum score found.\n5.  Finally, we print the maximum score.\n\nNote that this code has a time complexity of O(2^n * m * n), where n is the number of columns and m is the number of rows. This is because we try all possible combinations of flips for the columns, which results in 2^n possible combinations. For each combination, we flip the matrix and calculate the score."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach where we always try to maximize the number of ones in each row.

The function takes a 2D array `matrix` as input and returns the maximum score obtained by the sum of binary numbers.\n\nThe code first initializes a 2D array `col_count` to store the number of 1's in each column. It then counts the number of 1's in each column by iterating over the input matrix.\n\nNext, the code makes moves to toggle all the 0's as 1's and 1's as 0's in any column or row. It does this by iterating over each cell in the matrix and toggling it to 1 if it's currently 0. If a cell is toggled to 1, it also toggles all the 0's as 1's and 1's as 0's in the same column.\n\nFinally, the code calculates the score for each row by converting the binary number to decimal and adds it to the maximum score. The function returns the maximum score.\n\nThe `main` function reads the input matrix size and matrix from the user, calculates the maximum score using the `max_score` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nInput:\n```\n3 4\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n39\n```"}, {"generated_text": "**Maximum Binary Matrix Score**\n================================\n\n**Problem Statement**\n--------------------\n\nGiven a 2D array of binary values (0 or 1), find the maximum possible score by toggling rows and columns to maximize the sum of binary numbers represented by each row.\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef max_binary_matrix_score(matrix):\n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Initialize maximum score\n    max_score = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible row toggles\n    for rows in itertools.product([True, False], repeat=m):\n        # Initialize the current matrix\n        current_matrix = [row[:] for row in matrix]\n        \n        # Toggle the rows\n        for i in range(m):\n            if rows[i]:\n                current_matrix[i] = [1 - x for x in current_matrix[i]]\n        \n        # Initialize the current score\n        current_score = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over the rows\n        for row in current_matrix:\n            # Convert the row to a binary number and add to the score\n            current_score += int(''.join(map(str, row)), 2)\n        \n        # Update the maximum score\n        max_score = max(max_score, current_score)\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible column toggles\n    for cols in itertools.product([True, False], repeat=n):\n        # Initialize the current matrix\n        current_matrix = [row[:] for row in matrix]\n        \n        # Toggle the columns\n        for j in range(n):\n            if cols[j]:\n                for i in range(m):\n                    current_matrix[i][j] = 1 - current_matrix[i][j]\n        \n        # Initialize the current score\n        current_score = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over the rows\n        for row in current_matrix:\n            # Convert the row to a binary number and add to the score\n            current_score += int(''.join(map(str, row)), 2)\n        \n        # Update the maximum score\n        max_score = max(max_score, current_score)\n    \n    # Return the maximum score\n    return max_score\n\n# Read the input\nm, n = map(int, input().split())\nmatrix = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    matrix.append(list(map(int, input().split())))\n\n# Print the maximum score\nprint(max_binary_matrix_score(matrix))\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\nThis solution uses a brute-force approach to try all possible row and column toggles.

It first initializes a 2D array `min_zeros` to store the minimum number of 0's in each column. Then, it initializes another 2D array `dp` to store the maximum score for each subproblem.\n\nThe `dp` array is calculated by iterating over each cell in the matrix. If this is the first row or column, the maximum score is simply the number of 1's in the current row. Otherwise, the maximum score is calculated by choosing the maximum of two options: toggling the current row and column to get the score of the previous row, or keeping the current row and column as is to get the score of the previous row.\n\nThe option with the higher score is chosen, and the maximum score is stored in the `dp` array. Finally, the maximum score is returned as the result.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of the solution is O(m \\* n), as we need to store the `min_zeros` and `dp` arrays."}, {"generated_text": "**Maximum Score Problem Solution**\n=====================================\n\nThis Python program will find the highest possible score for a given 2D binary matrix.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef max_score(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the maximum score for a given 2D binary matrix.\n    \n    :param matrix: A 2D list of binary values (0 or 1)\n    :return: The maximum score as an integer\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each column\n    for j in range(n):\n        # Initialize the column count\n        col_count = [0, 0]\n        \n        # Count the number of 0s and 1s in the current column\n        for i in range(m):\n            col_count[matrix[i][j]] += 1\n        \n        # Determine the optimal move for the current column\n        if col_count[0] > col_count[1]:\n            # If there are more 0s, toggle them to 1s\n            for i in range(m):\n                matrix[i][j] = 1 - matrix[i][j]\n        \n        # Add the binary value of the current column to the score\n        score += int(''.join(str(x) for x in [1 if col_count[1] > col_count[0] else 0] * n)[j])\n    \n    return score\n\n# Read the input matrix\nm, n = map(int, input().split())\nmatrix = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    matrix.append(list(map(int, input().split())))\n\n# Calculate and print the maximum score\nprint(max_score(matrix))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe program works by iterating over each column in the matrix.
