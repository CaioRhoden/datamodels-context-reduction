{"id": 79, "input": "There is a legendary tale about Dragon Balls on Planet X: if one collects seven Dragon Balls, the Dragon God will show up and help you fulfill your wishes.\n\nOne day, you are surprised to discover that the tale might possibly be true: you found a Dragon Ball radar at a flea market! The radar shows you the locations of the seven Dragon Balls on Planet X. You want to waste no time checking the truth of the old legend about wish-granting for yourself!\n\nThere are $n$ cities in total on the Planet X, numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are currently at city $1$. To travel from one city to another, you can take any of $m$ bidirectional teleport trips, as many times as you like. The $i$-th teleporter costs $t_ i$ coins to use each time, and it can teleport you between cities $a_ i$ and $b_ i$. To collect a Dragon Ball, you simply need to visit the city where it\u2019s located, as indicated on your radar. It is possible that multiple Dragon Balls are at the same city; in this case you pick all of them all up at once if you visit that city.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \\leq n,m \\leq 200000)$, the number of cities and possible teleport trips. Then follow $m$ lines containing three space-separated integers $a_ i$, $b_ i$, and $t_ i$ each $(1 \\le a_ i, b_ i \\le n, 0 \\le t_ i \\le 10000)$, which, as explained above, represent the two cities connected by the teleport trip, and cost to use the teleporter. Then follows one line of seven space-separated integers, representing the city IDs of the seven Dragon Balls showing on the radar. Each ID $c$ satisfies the bound $1 \\leq c \\leq n$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of coins that you need to spend to collect all seven Dragon Balls shown on the Dragon Ball radar. If there is no way to complete this task, print $-1$ instead.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10 9\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n4 5 1\n5 6 1\n6 7 1\n7 8 1\n8 9 1\n9 10 1\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nSample Output:\n6\n", "difficulty": "MEDIUM", "generations": [{"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm.

The main idea is to maintain a priority queue of cities and their minimum cost to reach that city. We will start from city 1, and for each city, we will iterate over all the teleport trips that can reach that city. We will update the minimum cost to reach that city by considering the cost of the teleport trip and the minimum cost to reach the starting city of the teleport trip.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nimport sys\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start):\n    n = len(graph)\n    dist = [sys.maxsize] * n\n    dist[start] = 0\n    pq = [(0, start)]\n\n    while pq:\n        d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n\n        if d > dist[u]:\n            continue\n\n        for v, c in graph[u].items():\n            new_dist = d + c\n            if new_dist < dist[v]:\n                dist[v] = new_dist\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, v))\n\n    return dist\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    graph = {i: {} for i in range(1, n+1)}\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v, c = map(int, input().split())\n        graph[u][v] = c\n        graph[v][u] = c\n\n    dragon_balls = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    dist = dijkstra(graph, 1)\n\n    ans = sys.maxsize\n    for ball in dragon_balls:\n        ans = min(ans, dist[ball])\n\n    for ball in dragon_balls:\n        for v, c in graph[ball].items():\n            if v in dragon_balls:\n                continue\n            ans = min(ans, dist[ball] + c + dist[v])\n\n    if ans == sys.maxsize:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code first constructs a graph from the input data. Then it uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum cost to reach each city. For each Dragon Ball, it calculates the minimum cost to reach that city and then to reach all the other Dragon Balls from that city. The minimum of these costs is the minimum cost to collect all the Dragon Balls. If the minimum cost is still infinity, it means that it's impossible to collect all the Dragon Balls, so the code prints -1.
