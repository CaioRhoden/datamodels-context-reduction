{"id": 49, "input": "Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.\nEach rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\nSalmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.\nPlease help Salmon achieve this goal!\n\nIt can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   \n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   \n- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   \n- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \\leq i \\leq N$\n\n-----Output:-----\n- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. \n- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \\leq m1,m2 \\leq K$ and $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$. \n- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$.

The outer loop (`for _ in range(int(input()))`) is used to read the number of test cases and then execute the code inside the loop for each test case.\n\n2. Inside the loop, we read the values of `n` and `k` and store them in the variables `n` and `k` respectively.\n\n3. We then read the array `a` from the user and store it in the list `a`.\n\n4. The code then enters a loop where it processes each pair of adjacent colors in the array `a`.\n\n5. If `i + 1` is less than `n`, then it means that we have two colors to process. Otherwise, we only have one color to process.\n\n6. Inside the loop, we print the number of ducks of the first color (`a[i]`), the minimum between the number of ducks and `k` (`min(k, a[i])`), the number of ducks of the second color (`a[j]`), and the minimum between `k - a[i]` and `a[j]` (`min(k - a[i], a[j])`).\n\n7. The `min` function is used to ensure that we do not print a negative number for the second color, which is not possible because the number of ducks of each color is non-negative.\n\n8.

We first read the number of test cases (`T`).\n2. For each test case, we read the number of boxes (`N`) and the capacity of each box (`K`).\n3. We then read the number of ducks for each color.\n4. We iterate over each box.\n5. For each box, we calculate the number of ducks of the current color (`color1`) and the next color (`color2`).\n6. We calculate the number of ducks of `color1` and `color2` that we can fit in the current box (`m1` and `m2`).\n7. If we can fit all the ducks of `color1` and `color2` in the current box, we subtract `m1` and `m2` from the total number of ducks of `color1` and `color2`.\n8. We then print out the number of ducks of `color1` and `color2` in the current box.\n\nThis program assumes that the input is well-formed and that there is at least one valid solution for each test case."}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef place_ducks(n, k, colors):\n    boxes = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        colors.sort(reverse=True)\n        for j in range(len(colors) - 1):\n            if colors[j] > k:\n                boxes.append([colors[j], colors[j] % k, colors[j + 1], colors[j + 1] % k])\n                colors[j] -= colors[j] % k\n                colors[j + 1] -= colors[j + 1] % k\n                break\n            else:\n                boxes.append([colors[j], colors[j], colors[j + 1], colors[j + 1]])\n                colors[j] = 0\n                colors[j + 1] = 0\n                break\n        i += 1\n\n    for i in range(len(boxes)):\n        if boxes[i][0]!= 0:\n            print(*boxes[i])\n        else:\n            print(*[boxes[i][1], boxes[i][1], boxes[i][2], boxes[i][2]])\n\n\nt = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n    colors = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    place_ducks(n, k, colors)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We first define a function `place_ducks(n, k, colors)` to place the ducks into boxes.\n*   We initialize an empty list `boxes` to store the ducks in each box.\n*   We iterate over each box and sort the colors in descending order.\n*   We then iterate over the sorted colors and try to fill the box with two colors.\n*   If we have enough ducks of the current color to fill the box, we add the color and its count to the box and set the count to 0 in the `colors` list.\n*   If we don't have enough ducks of the current color to fill the box, we add the current color and the remaining ducks to the box, and then break the loop.\n*   After filling the box, we move to the next box and repeat the process.\n*   Finally, we print the ducks in each box.\n\nThis code meets the problem requirements and constraints.

It takes the number of ducks for each color as input and stores them in a list called `ducks`.\n4.  It then iterates over each pair of colors, with a step of 2 (to ensure that we are always considering two colors at a time).\n5.  For each pair of colors, it creates two boxes. The first box is initially filled with the ducks of the current color and the second box is initially empty.\n6.  It then enters a loop that continues until the first box is full (i.e., until the total number of ducks in the first box reaches K).\n7.  Inside the loop, it checks if the second color is still available. If it is, it adds the ducks of the second color to the second box. If not, it adds the ducks of the second color to the first box (but only if the first box is not already full).\n8.
