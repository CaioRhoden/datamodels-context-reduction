The idea is to first sort the digits in ascending order. If the smallest digit is '0', we need to move all the '0's to the end of the string. However, we need to handle the case where '0' is the first digit. In this case, we can't move all the '0's to the end, so we need to find the first '0' from the end and swap it with the first non-zero digit.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n\n    def minimum_Number(self, s):\n        # Convert the string into a list of characters for easier manipulation\n        s = list(s)\n        \n        # Sort the list of characters in ascending order\n        s.sort()\n        \n        # Initialize the index of the first non-zero digit\n        first_non_zero = 0\n        \n        # Find the first non-zero digit\n        while first_non_zero < len(s) and s[first_non_zero] == '0':\n            first_non_zero += 1\n        \n        # If the first digit is '0', find the first non-zero digit\n        if s[0] == '0':\n            # Swap the first '0' with the first non-zero digit\n            s[0], s[first_non_zero] = s[first_non_zero], s[0]\n        \n        # Join the list of characters into a string\n        return ''.join(s)\n```\n\nThis code sorts the digits in ascending order and then moves all the '0's to the end, except for the first non-zero digit if the smallest digit is '0'. This gives the smallest possible number without leading zeros.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(N * log(N)) due to the sorting operation, where N is the number of digits in the given number. The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the indices and the swapped digits."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. The idea is to first sort the digits in ascending order, and then try to minimize the number by rearranging the digits.

Then it iterates over the sorted digits and appends them to the result string, skipping any zeros that would make the result a leading zero.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N log N) due to the sorting step, where N is the number of digits in the input string. The space complexity is O(N) for storing the sorted digits."}, {"generated_text": "Here's the Python code that solves the problem in the expected time and space complexity.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n\n\tdef minimum_Number(self, s):\n\t\t# Convert the string into a list of integers\n\t\tnums = [int(x) for x in s]\n\t\t\n\t\t# Sort the list of integers in ascending order\n\t\tnums.sort()\n\t\t\n\t\t# Initialize the result string\n\t\tresult = ''\n\t\t\n\t\t# Initialize a flag to track if the result string starts with zero\n\t\tstart_with_zero = True\n\t\t\n\t\t# Iterate over the sorted list of integers\n\t\tfor num in nums:\n\t\t\t# If the number is zero and the result string starts with zero, skip it\n\t\t\tif num == 0 and start_with_zero:\n\t\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t\t# If the number is zero and the result string does not start with zero, update the flag\n\t\t\telif num == 0:\n\t\t\t\tstart_with_zero = False\n\t\t\t# Append the number to the result string\n\t\t\tresult += str(num)\n\t\t\n\t\t# Return the result string\n\t\treturn result\n```\n\nThis code first converts the input string into a list of integers. It then sorts the list in ascending order. The result string is initialized as an empty string, and a flag `start_with_zero` is used to track whether the result string starts with zero.\n\nThe code then iterates over the sorted list of integers. If a zero is encountered and the result string starts with zero, it skips the zero. If a zero is encountered and the result string does not start with zero, it updates the flag. Finally, it appends the number to the result string.\n\nThis code has a time complexity of O(N * log(N)) due to the sorting operation, and a space complexity of O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result string and the flag."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a sorting approach.

We check if the count of '0' is greater than 0 and the count of '1' is greater than 0 and the first digit is '0'. If this condition is true, we move the '1' to the front by creating a new list that starts with '1' and includes all other digits except '1'.\n4.  Finally, we construct the smallest number by joining the sorted digits into a string.\n\nYou can test this function with the example inputs to see the results."}]}
