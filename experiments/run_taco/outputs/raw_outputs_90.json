We create a dictionary `freq_S` to store the frequency of each character in the current substring of S, and another dictionary `freq_T` to store the frequency of each character in string T.\n2.  We iterate over the string T to initialize the frequency dictionary `freq_T`.\n3.  We then iterate over the substrings of S of length m (the length of T) and calculate the difference in frequency between the current substring and string T. This is done by iterating over the characters in the frequency dictionary `freq_S`, adding the absolute difference in frequency between the current character in S and T to the `diff` variable.\n4.  After calculating the difference in frequency for the current substring, we subtract the frequency of each character in T from the frequency of the same character in S to prepare for the next substring.\n5.  Finally, we print the difference in frequency for each substring of S, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the substring into string T.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nInput:\n\n```\nabcdefa\nddcb\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n2 3 3 3\n```\n\nThis means that to transform the substrings \"abcde\", \"bcdef\", \"cdefa\", and \"defab\" into \"ddcb\", we need 2, 3, 3, and 3 operations, respectively."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a Python program that calculates the distance between substrings of the given string `S` and the target string `T`.

It then prints the edit distance for each substring of `S` with length `|T|`.\n\nHere's an explanation of how it works:\n\n*   The `edit_distance` function calculates the edit distance between two strings `s` and `t` using dynamic programming. It fills up a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the edit distance between the first `i` characters of `s` and the first `j` characters of `t`.\n*   The `solve` function takes two strings `S` and `T` as input and calculates the edit distance for each substring of `S` with length `|T|`. It uses the `edit_distance` function to calculate the edit distance for each substring.\n*   The edit distance is calculated by iterating over the characters of the two strings. If the current characters are the same, there is no cost, otherwise there is a cost of 1. The minimum edit distance is then the minimum of the edit distance without the current character in `s` or `t`, the edit distance without the current character in `s` but with the current character in `t`, and the edit distance without the current character in both `s` and `t` but with a cost of 1.\n*   The result is then printed to the console.\n\nThis program has a time complexity of O(m \\* n) where m and n are the lengths of the two strings, and a space complexity of O(m \\* n) for the dynamic programming array."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Levenshtein Distance.

It first initializes two hash maps `freq_s` and `freq_t` to count the frequency of each character in the substring and the target string, respectively.\n2.  It then iterates over each character in the substring and the target string, updating the frequency counts in the hash maps.\n3.  After counting the frequency of each character, it calculates the distance by summing the absolute differences in the frequency counts between the substring and the target string.\n4.  Finally, it prints the calculated distances for each substring.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the input string s and m is the length of the target string t. The space complexity is O(n + m), as it needs to store the frequency counts in the hash maps."}]}
