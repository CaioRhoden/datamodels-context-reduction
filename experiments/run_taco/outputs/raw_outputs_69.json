{"id": 69, "input": "As you are probably aware, flight pricing can sometimes be surprisingly complex. For example, it can often be cheaper to take a much longer flight with several legs instead of flying directly between two airports. One of the reasons pricing seems to be complex is that airlines often try to obfuscate exactly how pricing works, in order to ensure that their customers choose more expensive flights.\n\nOne particular airline has deciced to take this obfuscation to the next level; they do not even offer an automated search of their flights. Instead, they describe their flights in a very peculiar format. For every one of their $N$ airports (which are numbered between $0$ and $N - 1$), they list either:\n - what airports they travel to from this airport, or\n - what airports they do not travel to from this airport.\n\n.\n\nTo compensate for this complexity, the airline sets the price of every direct flight between two airports to the same amount.\n\nCan you write a program that, given the descriptions of all the flights the airline provides, determine the minimum number of flights required to travel from airport $s$ to airport $t$?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $1 \\le N \\le 10^5$, the number of airports, and the two integers $s$ and $t$ ($0 \\le s, t < N$, $s \\neq t$).\n\nThe next $N$ lines each describe the outgoing flights of an airport, starting with airport $0$. The line starts with a letter. If this letter is N, you will get a list of all destination airports from this airport. If this letter is C, you will get a list of all airports that are not destinations from this airport.\n\nFollowing this letter is an integer $m$, the number of airports in the list. Finally, there will $m$ unique numbers $a_ i$ ($0 \\le a_ i < N$) on the line, the airports in the list.\n\nThe sum of $m$ over all airports is at most $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, the minimum number of flights required to travel from airport $s$ to airport $t$.\n\nIf there is no path, output \u201cimpossible\u201d.\n\n-----Explanation of Sample Input 1-----\nThe only flight from airport $0$ is to airport $2$. From airport $2$, there is also only a single flight going to airport $3$. From airport $3$, you can fly to any airport except airport $1$.\n\nSince no airport has a direct flight to airport $1$, there cannot be any possible flight plan from airport $0$ to $1$, so the answer is impossible\n\n-----Explanation of Sample Input 2-----\nThe only flight from airport $0$ is to airport $2$. From airport $2$, there is also only a single flight going to airport $3$. From airport $3$, you can fly to any airport except airport $0$.\n\nThus, there is a flight plan from $0$ to $1$ going from $0$ to $2$, to $3$, to $1$, which results in 3 flights. This is also the shortest flight plan.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4 0 1\nN 1 2\nC 1 2\nN 1 3\nC 1 1\nSample Output:\nimpossible\n", "difficulty": "HARD", "generations": [{"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the minimum number of flights required to travel from airport `s` to airport `t`.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef min_flights(N, s, t, flights):\n    # Build the graph\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]\n    for i, (desc, m, *dests) in enumerate(flights):\n        if desc == 'N':\n            graph[i].extend(map(int, dests))\n        else:\n            graph[i] = [j for j in range(N) if j not in map(int, dests)]\n\n    # BFS\n    visited = [False] * N\n    queue = deque([(s, 0)])\n    visited[s] = True\n\n    while queue:\n        u, dist = queue.popleft()\n        if u == t:\n            return dist\n        for v in graph[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                queue.append((v, dist + 1))\n\n    # If there is no path\n    return \"impossible\"\n\ndef parse_input():\n    N, s, t = map(int, input().split())\n    flights = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        desc = input().strip()[0]\n        m = int(input().strip().split()[1])\n        dests = list(map(int, input().strip().split()[1:]))\n        flights.append((desc, m, *dests))\n    return N, s, t, flights\n\nN, s, t, flights = parse_input()\nprint(min_flights(N, s, t, flights))\n```\n\nThis program reads the input, builds a graph from the flight descriptions, and then performs a BFS to find the minimum number of flights required to travel from `s` to `t`.

We maintain a queue of nodes to visit, a set of visited nodes, and a dictionary `distance` to store the distance of each node from `s`.\n3. We start by adding `s` to the queue, marking it as visited, and setting its distance to 0.\n4.
