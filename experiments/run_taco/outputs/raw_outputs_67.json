To calculate the amount of SegFaults Ram will get on the kth day, we need to consider the following rules:\n\n*   For the i^th day, Ram gets twice the SegFaults of the (i-1)^th day.\n*   For the i^th day, Ram gets thrice the SegFaults of the (i-2)^th day.\n*   As a bonus, Ram gets 3^i SegFaults for working on the i^th day.\n\nWe need to calculate the total amount of SegFaults Ram will get on the kth day modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n### Solution\n\n```python\ndef ram_segfault(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total amount of SegFaults Ram will get on the kth day.\n\n    Args:\n        k (int): The day number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The total amount of SegFaults modulo 10^9 + 7.\n    \"\"\"\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    if k == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif k == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif k == 2:\n        return 3 + 2\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the SegFaults for each day\n    segfaults = [0] * (k + 1)\n    segfaults[1] = 1\n    segfaults[2] = 3 + 2\n\n    # Calculate the SegFaults for each day from 3 to k\n    for i in range(3, k + 1):\n        segfaults[i] = (segfaults[i-1] * 2 + segfaults[i-2] * 3 + 3**i) % MOD\n\n    return segfaults[k]\n\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\n\n# Run the test cases\nfor _ in range(t):\n    k = int(input())\n    print(ram_segfault(k))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe solution uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the SegFaults for each day from 1 to k. The `ram_segfault` function takes an integer k as input and returns the total amount of SegFaults Ram will get on the kth day modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nThe function first handles the base cases where k is 0, 1, or 2. For k = 0, the function returns 0, since Ram doesn't get any SegFaults on the 0th day. For k = 1, the function returns 1, since Ram gets 1 SegFault on the 1st day. For k = 2, the function returns 3 + 2, since Ram gets 3 SegFaults on the 1st day (twice the SegFaults of the 0th day) and 2 SegFaults on the 2nd day (thrice the SegFaults of the 0th day).\n\nFor k >= 3, the function calculates the SegFaults for each day from 3 to k using a loop. On each iteration, the function updates the SegFaults for the current day i by adding the SegFaults for the previous day (i-1) multiplied by 2, the SegFaults for the day before that (i-2) multiplied by 3, and 3^i as a bonus. The function takes the result modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid overflow.\n\nFinally, the function returns the total amount of SegFaults Ram will get on the kth day modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   For k = 2, the function returns 5, since Ram gets 3 SegFaults on the 1st day and 2 SegFaults on the 2nd day.\n*   For k = 3, the function returns 14, since Ram gets 3 SegFaults on the 1st day, 6 SegFaults on the 2nd day (twice the SegFaults of the 1st day), and 3^3 = 27 as a bonus.\n*   For k = 6, the function returns 2870, since Ram gets 3 SegFaults on the 1st day, 6 SegFaults on the 2nd day, 12 SegFaults on the 3rd day, 24 SegFaults on the 4th day, 48 SegFaults on the 5th day, and 3^6 = 729 as a bonus."}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python program that solves the problem using dynamic programming.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_segfaults(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total SegFaults Ram gets on the k^th day.\n\n    Args:\n    k (int): The day for which SegFaults need to be calculated.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The total SegFaults Ram gets on the k^th day.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the list to store the SegFaults for each day\n    segfaults = [0] * (k + 1)\n\n    # For the 0th day, Ram gets 1 SegFault\n    segfaults[0] = 1\n\n    # For the 1st day, Ram gets 2 * SegFaults of the 0th day\n    segfaults[1] = 2 * segfaults[0]\n\n    # For each day from 2nd to kth day\n    for i in range(2, k + 1):\n        # Calculate the SegFaults for the ith day\n        segfaults[i] = (2 * segfaults[i - 1] + 3 * segfaults[i - 2] + pow(3, i)) % (10**9 + 7)\n\n    # Return the total SegFaults for the kth day\n    return segfaults[k]\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    t = int(input())\n\n    # Process each test case\n    for _ in range(t):\n        # Read the day for which SegFaults need to be calculated\n        k = int(input())\n\n        # Calculate and print the total SegFaults for the kth day\n        print(calculate_segfaults(k))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the total SegFaults for each day.

We use dynamic programming to store the SegFaults for each day in the `dp` array.\n3. We initialize the first element of the `dp` array to 1, which represents the SegFaults for the 0^th day (Ram paid 1 SegFault for his job).\n4. We then iterate from 1 to `k` and calculate the SegFaults for each day using the formula: `current_segfaults = dp[i - 1] * 2 + dp[i - 2] * 3 + (3 ** i)`.\n5. We update the dynamic programming table by storing the calculated SegFaults in the `dp` array.\n6. Finally, we return the SegFaults for the `k^th` day modulo 10^9 + 7.\n7. In the `main` function, we read the input and call the `calculate_segfaults` function for each test case.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(k)\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(k)\n\nNote: The time complexity is linear because we only need to iterate from 1 to `k` to calculate the SegFaults for each day.
