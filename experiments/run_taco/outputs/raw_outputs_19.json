{"id": 19, "input": "Your publishing house has decided to use monkeys randomly typing at keyboards to write great works of literature. You are the supervisor for one monkey with a keyboard containing K keys, each of which is labeled with an uppercase English letter. (There may be multiple keys displaying the same letter.) The monkey will start with an empty string and repeat the following S times: choose a key from its keyboard uniformly at random and press it, adding a copy of that key's letter to the right end of the string. The final resulting string will have length S.\n\nYou have a target word of length L that you are hoping the monkey will type. (The target word will not necessarily be a real English word.) This target word may even appear multiple times in what the monkey types. (Overlapping instances count too -- for example, if \"ABA\" is the target word and the monkey types \"ABABA\", that contains two instances of the target.)\n\nYou plan to pay the monkey one banana for each instance of the target word that it types. When you go to inspect the monkey's work, you will bring along the minimum number of bananas that you need to ensure that you will always have enough bananas to pay the monkey, no matter what it has typed. Then, you will pay the monkey one banana for each instance of the target word that it actually typed. You will keep the remaining bananas that you brought with you.\n\nWhat is the expected number of bananas that you will get to keep?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each consists of three lines. The first contains three space-separated positive integers: K, L, and S. The second contains a string of K uppercase English letters representing the monkey's keyboard. The third contains a string of L uppercase English letters representing the target word.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output one line containing \"Case #x: y\", where y is the expected number of bananas you will get to keep after paying the monkey.\n\ny will be considered correct if it is within an absolute or relative error of 10-6 of the correct answer. \nLimits\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100.\n\nContraints\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 100.\n1 \u2264 L \u2264 S \u2264 100.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n3\n7 6 6\nBANANAS\nMONKEY\n2 3 4\nAA\nAAA\n2 1 2\nAB\nB\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\nCase #1: 0.0\nCase #2: 0.0\nCase #3: 1.0\n\nExplanation\n\nIn Case #1, the monkey has no chance of typing the target word \"MONKEY\" even once (because his keyboard lacks most of the letters in \"MONKEY\"), so you do not bring any bananas along when you visit, and of course you do not pay any. Poor monkey!\n\nIn Case #2, the monkey is guaranteed to type \"AAAA\", which has two overlapping instances of the target word \"AAA\". You will bring two bananas and then pay both.\n\nIn Case #3, the monkey will produce the following outputs with equal probability (1/4 each): \"AA\", \"AB\", \"BA\", \"BB\". These have 0, 1, 1, and 2 instances of the target word, respectively. You must bring 2 bananas to be ready for the \"BB\" case, but you will on average pay (0 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 1.\n", "difficulty": "UNKNOWN_DIFFICULTY", "generations": [{"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to calculate the probability of the monkey typing the target word at any given position.

Therefore, the probability that the monkey types the target word at a given position is `p = (S - L + 1) * (1/K)^L`.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected number of instances of the target word that the monkey types as follows:\n\n`E[X] = p * S = (S - L + 1) * (1/K)^L * S`\n\nHowever, we need to consider the cases where the monkey types the target word multiple times. To do this, we can use the concept of the expected value of a binomial distribution. Let's define `Y` as the number of instances of the target word that the monkey types, and `n` as the number of trials (i.e., the number of positions where the monkey can type the target word). Then, `Y` follows a binomial distribution with parameters `n` and `p`.\n\nThe expected value of `Y` is `E[Y] = n * p`, and the variance of `Y` is `Var[Y] = n * p * (1 - p)`.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected number of bananas that we will get to keep as follows:\n\n`E[bananas] = S - E[Y] = S - (S - L + 1) * (1/K)^L * S`\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this solution:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bananas():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        k, l, s = map(int, input().split())\n        keyboard = input()\n        target = input()\n\n        p = (s - l + 1) * (1 / k) ** l\n        bananas = s - (s - l + 1) * (1 / k) ** l * s\n\n        print(f\"Case #{_ + 1}: {bananas:.1f}\")\n\ncalculate_bananas()\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, calculates the expected number of bananas that we will get to keep, and prints the result. The expected value is calculated using the formula `E[bananas] = S - (S - L + 1) * (1/K)^L * S`, which is derived from the properties of Markov chains and the binomial distribution. The result is printed with a precision of 1 decimal place."}, {"generated_text": "## Problem: Expected Bananas\n\nWe will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.\n\n### Code:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef expected_bananas(K, L, S, keyboard, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the expected number of bananas that we will get to keep.\n\n    :param K: The number of keys on the keyboard.\n    :param L: The length of the target word.\n    :param S: The length of the monkey's output.\n    :param keyboard: A string representing the monkey's keyboard.\n    :param target: A string representing the target word.\n    :return: The expected number of bananas that we will get to keep.\n    \"\"\"\n    @lru_cache(None)\n    def dp(i, j):\n        # Base case: if we have typed the entire target word, return 1.\n        if i == L:\n            return 1\n        # If we have not typed any characters yet, return 0.\n        elif i == 0:\n            return 0\n        # Otherwise, calculate the probability of typing the current character.\n        else:\n            prob = 1 / K\n            # Calculate the expected number of bananas if we type the current character.\n            if target[j-1] == keyboard[i-1]:\n                return prob * dp(i-1, j-1) + (1-prob) * dp(i-1, j)\n            else:\n                return (1-prob) * dp(i-1, j)\n\n    # Calculate the expected number of bananas.\n    return S - dp(S, L)\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())\n    for t in range(1, T+1):\n        K, L, S = map(int, input().split())\n        keyboard = input()\n        target = input()\n        print(f\"Case #{t}: {expected_bananas(K, L, S, keyboard, target)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThis code defines a function `expected_bananas` that takes the number of keys `K`, the length of the target word `L`, the length of the monkey's output `S`, the monkey's keyboard `keyboard`, and the target word `target` as input. It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the expected number of bananas that we will get to keep.\n\nThe function `dp` is a recursive function that calculates the expected number of bananas if we have typed the first `i` characters of the target word and the monkey has typed the first `j` characters of its output. The base case is when we have typed the entire target word, in which case we return 1. If we have not typed any characters yet, we return 0.\n\nOtherwise, we calculate the probability of typing the current character and use this probability to calculate the expected number of bananas if we type the current character. If the current character matches the corresponding character in the target word, we use the recursive formula `dp(i-1, j-1)` to calculate the expected number of bananas. Otherwise, we use the formula `dp(i-1, j)`.\n\nThe `main` function reads the input and calls the `expected_bananas` function for each test case. It prints the result for each test case.\n\n### Time complexity:\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(K \\* L \\* S), where K is the number of keys, L is the length of the target word, and S is the length of the monkey's output. This is because we use a recursive function with a depth of O(S) and a width of O(L), and we use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n### Space complexity:\n\nThe space complexity of this code is O(K \\* L \\* S), where K is the number of keys, L is the length of the target word, and S is the length of the monkey's output.
