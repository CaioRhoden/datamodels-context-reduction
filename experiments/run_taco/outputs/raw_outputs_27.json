We can solve this problem by sorting the coins in descending order of gold coins and then selecting the top X coins for gold, the next Y coins for silver, and the remaining Z coins for bronze.\n\nIn the code, we first read the input from standard input using the `read_input` function. We then sort the coins in descending order of gold coins using the `sort` method and a lambda function as the key.\n\nWe then select the top X coins for gold, the next Y coins for silver, and the remaining Z coins for bronze using list slicing. We calculate the maximum total coins by summing up the gold, silver, and bronze coins.\n\nFinally, we print the maximum total coins using the `print` function.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\nThe code can be used to solve the problem for different inputs. For example, we can use the following inputs:\n\n*   Input 1:\n    ```\n1 2 1\n2 4 4\n3 2 1\n7 6 7\n5 2 3\n```\n*   Input 2:\n    ```\n3 3 2\n16 17 1\n2 7 5\n2 16 12\n17 7 7\n13 2 10\n12 18 3\n16 15 19\n5 6 2\n```\n*   Input 3:\n    ```\n6 2 4\n33189 87907 277349742\n71616 46764 575306520\n8801 53151 327161251\n58589 4337 796697686\n66854 17565 289910583\n50598 35195 478112689\n13919 88414 103962455\n7953 69657 699253752\n44255 98144 468443709\n2332 42580 752437097\n39752 19060 845062869\n60126 74101 382963164\n```\nThe code will output the maximum total coins for each input."}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem.

The priority queue is used to keep track of the people with the most coins, which allows us to pop the person with the most coins from the queue when we need to select a person for each type of coin.

It then tries to give each person the most valuable coins they have.\n\nHowever, this program does not consider the case where a person has multiple maximum amounts of coins. This is not possible with the given constraints, but if it were possible, we would need a more complex approach.\n\nAlso note that this program assumes that the input is well-formed and does not contain any errors. In a real-world scenario, you would want to add some error checking code to handle this.\n\nHere is a sample usage of this program:\n\n```\n$ echo \"1 2 1\n2 4 4\n3 2 1\n7 6 7\n5 2 3\" | python program.py\n18\n\n$ echo \"3 3 2\n16 17 1\n2 7 5\n2 16 12\n17 7 7\n13 2 10\n12 18 3\n16 15 19\n5 6 2\" | python program.py\n110\n\n$ echo \"6 2 4\n33189 87907 277349742\n71616 46764 575306520\n8801 53151 327161251\n58589 4337 796697686\n66854 17565 289910583\n50598 35195 478112689\n13919 88414 103962455\n7953 69657 699253752\n44255 98144 468443709\n2332 42580 752437097\n39752 19060 845062869\n60126 74101 382963164\" | python program.py\n3093929975\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution that utilizes a heap data structure to efficiently select the people with the most coins.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef max_coins():\n    # Read the input\n    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())\n    people = []\n    for _ in range(x + y + z):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        people.append((a, b, c))\n\n    # Sort people by their maximum coins in descending order\n    people.sort(key=lambda x: max(x), reverse=True)\n\n    # Create heaps for each color of coins\n    gold_heap = []\n    silver_heap = []\n    bronze_heap = []\n\n    # Initialize the total coins\n    total_coins = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the people\n    for a, b, c in people:\n        # Push the person's coins into the corresponding heap\n        if len(gold_heap) < x:\n            heapq.heappush(gold_heap, -a)\n            total_coins += a\n        elif len(silver_heap) < y:\n            heapq.heappush(silver_heap, -b)\n            total_coins += b\n        elif len(bronze_heap) < z:\n            heapq.heappush(bronze_heap, -c)\n            total_coins += c\n        else:\n            # If the heap is full, pop the smallest coin and push the new coin\n            if gold_heap and gold_heap[0] < -a:\n                total_coins += -heapq.heappop(gold_heap)\n                heapq.heappush(gold_heap, -a)\n            if silver_heap and silver_heap[0] < -b:\n                total_coins += -heapq.heappop(silver_heap)\n                heapq.heappush(silver_heap, -b)\n            if bronze_heap and bronze_heap[0] < -c:\n                total_coins += -heapq.heappop(bronze_heap)\n                heapq.heappush(bronze_heap, -c)\n\n    print(total_coins)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    max_coins()\n```\n\nThis solution reads the input, sorts the people by their maximum coins in descending order, and then uses three heaps to efficiently select the people with the most coins. The total coins are updated accordingly.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O((x+y+z)log(x+y+z)) due to the sorting and heap operations. The space complexity is O(x+y+z) for storing the people's coins and the heaps."}]}
