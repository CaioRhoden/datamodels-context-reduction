Initialize a dictionary `count` to store the count of each character in the gene.\n2.  Initialize `min_len` to `n`, which represents the length of the entire gene.\n3.  Iterate through the gene, updating the count of each character.\n4.  If all characters have equal counts, update `min_len` to the current index plus one.\n5.  If any character has more than `n/4` counts, update the count of that character to `n/4` and update `min_len` to the current index plus one minus the difference between the current count and `n/4`.\n6.  Return `n - min_len`, which represents the length of the smallest possible substring to replace.\n\n#### Example Usage\n\n```python\nprint(steadyGene(\"GAAATAAA\"))  # Output: 5\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the gene, and a space complexity of O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space to store the counts and the minimum length."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a Python program that iterates over the string and keeps track of the count of each character.
