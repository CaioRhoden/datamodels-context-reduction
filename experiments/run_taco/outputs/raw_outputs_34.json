We create a hashmap `freq_map` to store the frequency of each substring in the input string `s`.\n2.  We iterate over all substrings of `s` using two nested loops, and for each substring, we sort its characters to treat anagrams as equal.\n3.  We store the sorted substring in the hashmap and increment its frequency by 1.\n4.  We then iterate over the values in the hashmap and count the number of anagramic pairs using the formula `count * (count - 1) // 2`.\n5.  Finally, we print the total number of anagramic pairs for each input string.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Input: `rama`\n    Output: `2`\n*   Input: `abba`\n    Output: `4`\n*   Input: `abcd`\n    Output: `0`"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program that uses a hash map to store the frequency of substrings and their reverse.

It defines a function `anagramic_pairs(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and calculates the number of anagramic pairs in `s`.\n2. It generates all substrings of `s` and their reverse using nested loops.\n3. It stores the frequency of each substring and its reverse in a hash map `freq`.\n4. It calculates the number of anagramic pairs by iterating over the frequency map and applying the formula `count * (count - 1) // 2` for each count.\n5. It defines a `main()` function that reads input strings, calls `anagramic_pairs(s)` for each string, and prints the result.\n6. It uses the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard to ensure that the `main()` function is only executed when the script is run directly.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n^3), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it generates all substrings and their reverse, which takes O(n^2) time, and then iterates over the frequency map, which takes O(n) time.

We use a hashmap `freq_map` to store the frequency of each sorted character sequence in the input string.\n3.  We generate all possible substrings of the input string using two nested loops.\n4.  For each substring, we sort its characters to create a unique identifier.\n5.  We check if the frequency of the sorted substring is greater than 1 in the `freq_map`. If it is, it means we have found an anagramic pair, and we increment the count of anagramic pairs by the frequency minus 1 (to avoid counting the same pair multiple times).\n6.  We update the frequency of the sorted substring in the `freq_map`.\n7.

We generate all substrings of the given string `s` using two nested loops.\n3. For each substring, we sort its characters to create a key for the hashmap. This is because anagrams have the same characters, but in a different order.\n4. We increment the frequency of the key in the hashmap.\n5. Finally, we count the anagramic pairs by summing up the product of each frequency with the number of ways to choose two elements from it (i.e., `freq * (freq - 1) // 2`).\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n^3) where n is the length of the string.

The `count_anagramic_pairs` function generates all possible substrings of the input string `s`.\n2. For each substring, it sorts the characters to create a key for the hashmap.\n3.

We use a hashmap (`freq_map`) to store the frequency of each substring.\n2.  We iterate over all possible substrings of the input string `s`.\n3.  For each substring, we sort the characters to treat anagrams as the same.\n4.  We increment the frequency of the sorted substring in the hashmap.\n5.  We iterate over the frequency map and count the number of anagramic pairs for each substring.\n6.  We use the formula `count * (count - 1) // 2` to calculate the number of pairs for each substring.\n7.  We sum up the counts of anagramic pairs for all substrings to get the final answer.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nInput:\n```\n3\nrama\nabba\nabcd\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n2\n4\n0\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_anagramic_pairs(s):\n    # Create a hashmap to store the frequency of characters\n    freq_map = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    # Initialize variables to store the total count and the current window sum\n    total_count = 0\n    window_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        # Add the frequency of the current character to the window sum\n        window_sum += freq_map[char]\n        \n        # Increment the frequency of the current character in the hashmap\n        freq_map[char] += 1\n        \n        # If this is not the first character, add the number of anagramic pairs to the total count\n        if i > 0:\n            total_count += (i - 1) - window_sum + 1\n    \n    return total_count\n\n# Read the number of strings\nT = int(input())\n\n# Process each string\nfor _ in range(T):\n    s = input()\n    print(count_anagramic_pairs(s))\n```\n\nThis program uses a hashmap to store the frequency of characters in the current window.

Create a hashmap to store the frequency of characters.\n2.  Initialize variables to store the total count and the current window sum.\n3.  Iterate over the string, and for each character, add its frequency to the window sum and increment its frequency in the hashmap.\n4.  If this is not the first character, add the number of anagramic pairs to the total count. This is calculated as `(i - 1) - window_sum + 1`, where `i` is the current index.\n5.  Return the total count.\n\nThis program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it iterates over the string once and performs constant-time operations inside the loop.

In the `main` function, we read the number of input strings, and for each string, we call `count_anagramic_pairs` and print the result.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nInput:\n```\n3\nrama\nabba\nabcd\n```\nOutput:\n```\n2\n4\n0\n```"}, {"generated_text": "**Anagramic Pairs Counter**\n\nThis Python program takes a string as input and counts the number of anagramic pairs.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_anagramic_pairs(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of anagramic pairs in a given string.\n\n    :param s: Input string\n    :return: Number of anagramic pairs\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(s)\n    count = 0\n    count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        char_count = [0] * 26\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            char_count[ord(s[j]) - ord('a')] += 1\n            count_dict[tuple(char_count)] += 1\n            count += count_dict[tuple(char_count)] - 1\n\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        s = input()\n        print(count_anagramic_pairs(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We use a `defaultdict` to store the count of each character combination.\n*   For each substring, we create a character count array and use it as a key in the `count_dict`.\n*   We then increment the count for the current substring by the count of the same character combination in the `count_dict`.\n*   The final count is the sum of the counts for all substrings.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Input: `rama`\n    Output: `2`\n*   Input: `abba`\n    Output: `4`\n*   Input: `abcd`\n    Output: `0`\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity is O(n^2 \\* 26), where n is the length of the input string and 26 is the number of lowercase English alphabets.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string."}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program that uses a hash map to count the frequency of each substring and then calculates the number of anagramic pairs.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_anagramic_pairs(s):\n    # Initialize a hash map to store the frequency of each substring\n    freq_map = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    # Initialize a variable to store the total count of anagramic pairs\n    total_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string to generate all substrings\n    for length in range(1, len(s) + 1):\n        for i in range(len(s) - length + 1):\n            substring = s[i:i + length]\n            \n            # Sort the substring to create a key for the hash map\n            sorted_substring = ''.join(sorted(substring))\n            \n            # Increment the frequency count of the sorted substring\n            freq_map[sorted_substring] += 1\n            \n            # If the frequency count is greater than 1, it means we have found an anagramic pair\n            if freq_map[sorted_substring] > 1:\n                # Increment the total count of anagramic pairs\n                total_count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of anagramic pairs\n    return total_count\n\n# Read the number of strings\nt = int(input())\n\n# Process each string\nfor _ in range(t):\n    # Read the string\n    s = input()\n    \n    # Count the number of anagramic pairs\n    count = count_anagramic_pairs(s)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(count)\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n*   It uses a `defaultdict` to store the frequency of each substring.\n*   It generates all substrings of a given string using two nested loops.\n*   For each substring, it sorts the characters to create a key for the hash map.\n*   It increments the frequency count of the sorted substring in the hash map.\n*   If the frequency count is greater than 1, it means we have found an anagramic pair, so it increments the total count of anagramic pairs.\n*   Finally, it prints the total count of anagramic pairs for each string.\n\nThis program has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the string, because it generates all substrings of a given string and sorts the characters for each substring.
