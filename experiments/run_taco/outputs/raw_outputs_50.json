This means that the gcd of a sequence A_1,..., A_N is the same as the gcd of A_1, A_2 - A_1,..., A_N - A_{N-1}. \n\nWe can use this property to count the number of sequences that have a common divisor d. Let's consider the number of sequences where the first element is d. The second element can be either d or a multiple of d, and so on. \n\nThis problem is equivalent to the one where the first element is 1 and we need to count the number of sequences where all elements are multiples of d. \n\nTo count the number of sequences where all elements are multiples of d, we can observe that the first element can be any multiple of d, the second element can be any multiple of d that is greater than or equal to the first element, and so on. \n\nThis is equivalent to the number of sequences where all elements are 1, except that the first element can be any multiple of d. \n\nThe number of sequences where all elements are 1 is K^(N-1), and the number of sequences where all elements are 1 except the first element which is a multiple of d is d*K^(N-2). \n\nSo, the total number of sequences where all elements are multiples of d is (K/d)^(N-1) + (K/(d*2))^(N-1) +... + (K/(d*K))^(N-1). \n\nNow, we can use the property of the sum of a geometric series to simplify this expression. The sum of a geometric series with first term a and common ratio r is a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms. \n\nIn this case, the first term is (K/d)^(N-1) and the common ratio is 1/d. The number of terms is K/d. \n\nSo, the sum of the geometric series is (K/d)^(N-1) * (1 - (1/d)^((K/d))) / (1 - 1/d). \n\nNow, we can use the property of the sum of an infinite geometric series to simplify this expression. The sum of an infinite geometric series with first term a and common ratio r is a / (1 - r), where |r| < 1. \n\nIn this case, the first term is (K/d)^(N-1) and the common ratio is 1/d. \n\nSo, the sum of the infinite geometric series is (K/d)^(N-1) / (1 - 1/d). \n\nNow, we can use the property of the product of two fractions to simplify this expression. The product of two fractions a/b and c/d is (ac) / (bd). \n\nIn this case, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of (K/d)^(N-1) / (1 - 1/d) by d^((K/d) - 1) to get (K/d)^(N-1) * d^((K/d) - 1) / (d^((K/d) - 1) * (1 - 1/d)). \n\nNow, we can simplify the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is (K/d)^(N-1) * d^((K/d) - 1) = K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - 1 - N + 1) = K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N). \n\nThe denominator is d^((K/d) - 1) * (1 - 1/d) = d^((K/d) - 1) * ((d-1)/d) = (d-1) * d^((K/d) - 2). \n\nSo, the simplified expression is K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N) / ((d-1) * d^((K/d) - 2)). \n\nNow, we can use the property of the quotient of two fractions to simplify this expression. The quotient of two fractions a/b and c/d is (ad) / (bc). \n\nIn this case, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N) / ((d-1) * d^((K/d) - 2)) by d^((K/d) - 2) to get K^(N-1) * d^((K/d) - N) * d^((K/d) - 2) / (d-1) * d^((K/d) - 2) * d^((K/d) - 2). \n\nNow, we can simplify the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N) * d^((K/d) - 2) = K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N + (K/d) - 2) = K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N - 2 + K/d). \n\nThe denominator is (d-1) * d^((K/d) - 2) * d^((K/d) - 2) = (d-1) * d^(2 * (K/d) - 4). \n\nSo, the simplified expression is K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N - 2 + K/d) / ((d-1) * d^(2 * (K/d) - 4)). \n\nNow, we can use the property of the product of two fractions to simplify this expression. The product of two fractions a/b and c/d is (ac) / (bd). \n\nIn this case, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N - 2 + K/d) / ((d-1) * d^(2 * (K/d) - 4)) by d^(2 * (K/d) - 4) to get K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N - 2 + K/d) * d^(2 * (K/d) - 4) / (d-1) * d^(2 * (K/d) - 4) * d^(2 * (K/d) - 4). \n\nNow, we can simplify the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N - 2 + K/d) * d^(2 * (K/d) - 4) = K^(N-1) * d^(K/d - N - 2 + K/d + 2 * (K/d) - 4) = K^(N-1) * d^(3 * (K/d) - N - 2 - 4). \n\nThe denominator is (d-1) * d^(2 * (K/d) - 4) * d^(2 * (K/d) - 4) = (d-1) * d^(4 * (K/d) - 8). \n\nSo, the simplified expression is K^(N-1) * d^(3 * (K/d) - N - 2 - 4) / ((d-1) * d^(4 * (K/d) - 8)). \n\nNow, we can use the property of the quotient of two fractions to simplify this expression.

The `power` function calculates the power of a number modulo MOD using exponentiation by squaring. The `solve` function calculates the sum of GCDs over all sequences by iterating over possible GCD values and counting the number of sequences with each GCD.\n\nIn the `solve` function, we use the fact that the number of sequences with a GCD of `gcd` is equal to the product of the number of ways to choose `gcd` from the range `[1, K]` and the number of ways to choose the remaining elements from the range `[gcd, K]`.\n\nWe then add the product of the GCD and the count to the total sum modulo MOD.
