We first create a frequency counter for the entire string. This counter will keep track of the frequency of each character in the string.\n2.  We initialize variables to keep track of the minimum length of the window, the number of required characters, the number of formed characters, and the frequency counter for the current window.\n3.  We then try to extend the window to the right by adding characters to the frequency counter. If the frequency of a character in the window is equal to its frequency in the entire string, we increment the number of formed characters.\n4.  If the number of formed characters is equal to the number of required characters, we try to shrink the window from the left by removing characters from the frequency counter. If the length of the window is less than the minimum length found so far, we update the minimum length.\n5.  We repeat steps 3 and 4 until we have found the minimum length of the window.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(256*N) because we are iterating over the string twice: once to create the frequency counter and once to extend and shrink the window.

We initialize `min_length` to infinity to store the length of the smallest substring that contains all characters at least once.\n2.  We iterate over the string using two pointers, `i` and `j`. `i` is the starting pointer, and `j` is the ending pointer.\n3.  Inside the outer loop, we create a dictionary `char_count` to count the frequency of each character in the substring from `i` to `j`.\n4.  We use a nested loop to iterate over the substring from `i` to `j` and update the frequency of each character in `char_count`.\n5.  We check if all characters are present at least once by comparing the length of `char_count` with the length of the set of unique characters in the string. If they are equal, it means all characters are present at least once in the substring.\n6.  If all characters are present, we update `min_length` with the length of the current substring.\n7.  After the outer loop, `min_length` stores the length of the smallest substring that contains all characters at least once. If no such substring is found, `min_length` remains infinity, and we return 0.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(256.N) because we iterate over the string with two pointers, and for each character, we update the frequency count.

The `right` pointer starts from the beginning of the string and moves to the right.\n4.  For each character in the string, we increment its count in the `window_counts` dictionary. If the count of a character in the window is equal to its count in the string, we increment the `formed_chars` variable.\n5.

The window is represented by two pointers, `left` and `right`, which indicate the start and end of the window, respectively.\n\nThe solution first creates a frequency map of the characters in the string. Then, it iterates over the string, adding characters to the window frequency map as it goes. When the window contains all unique characters, it shrinks the window from the left by removing characters from the window frequency map until the window no longer contains all unique characters.\n\nThe minimum window length is updated whenever the window is shrunk, and the solution returns this minimum window length at the end.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(256.N), where N is the length of the string. This is because each character in the string is processed at most twice: once when it is added to the window frequency map, and once when it is removed from the window frequency map.\n\n**Auxiliary Space**\n\nThe auxiliary space used by this solution is O(256), which is the space required to store the frequency map of the characters in the string."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach along with a frequency dictionary to keep track of the characters and their counts in the current window.

We first count the frequency of each character in the string using a hash map `char_count`.\n2.  We then initialize the required number of unique characters (`required_chars`) and a hash map `window_counts` to store the frequency of characters in the current window.\n3.  We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the sliding window.\n4.  We expand the window to the right by adding the current character to `window_counts` and incrementing its count.\n5.  When the size of `window_counts` becomes equal to `required_chars`, we try to minimize the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right.\n6.  We decrement the count of the character at the `left` index in `window_counts` and remove it if its count becomes zero.\n7.  We update the minimum length of the window if the current window size is smaller than the minimum length found so far.\n8.  Finally, we return the minimum length of the window if it is found; otherwise, we return 0.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(256.N) and an auxiliary space complexity of O(256), as required."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach along with a hash map to keep track of the frequency of each character in the string and the current window.

We first create a frequency dictionary `freq_dict` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2.  We initialize variables `min_len` to store the minimum length of the window, `left` to store the left pointer of the sliding window, and `formed` to store the number of characters in the window that have been formed.\n3.  We create a window frequency dictionary `window_freq` to store the frequency of each character in the current window.\n4.  We iterate over the string using the right pointer `right`. For each character, we add it to the window and update the `formed` count if the frequency of the character in the window equals the frequency of the character in the string.\n5.  If the window is full (i.e., `formed` equals the length of the frequency dictionary), we shrink the window by moving the left pointer `left` to the right. We update `min_len` if the current window size is smaller than the minimum length found so far.\n6.  We remove the character at the left pointer from the window and update the `formed` count if the frequency of the character in the window is less than the frequency of the character in the string.\n7.  Finally, we return `min_len` if it is not infinity, indicating that a window with all characters has been found. If no such window is found, we return 0.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(256.N) and an auxiliary space complexity of O(256), where N is the length of the input string."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window technique along with a frequency dictionary to keep track of the characters in the current window.

It starts with an empty window and expands it to the right, trying to include all characters in the string at least once. When it has included all characters, it tries to shrink the window from the left, maintaining the property that all characters are included at least once. The minimum length of the window seen during this process is the smallest window length that contains all characters of the string at least once.

Next, it iterates over the string to find the minimum window length. For each character, it checks if it's in the window counts.

We then initialize `min_length` as infinity to store the minimum length of the substring that contains all unique characters.\n3.  We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to form a sliding window.\n4.  We maintain a copy of `char_freq` as `char_freq_copy` to keep track of the frequency of characters within the current window.\n5.  As we expand the window to the right, we decrement the frequency of the character at the `right` pointer in `char_freq_copy`. If the frequency becomes zero, we increment `formed_chars` to indicate that we have formed one more unique character.\n6.  When we have formed all unique characters within the window, we try to minimize the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right. If the character at the `left` pointer is in `char_freq_copy`, we increment its frequency in `char_freq_copy` and decrement `formed_chars` if the frequency becomes positive.\n7.  We update `min_length` with the minimum length of the substring that contains all unique characters.\n8.

First, we create a frequency map `char_freq` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2. We also create a copy `char_freq_copy` of the frequency map to use during the sliding window process.\n3. We initialize `min_window_len` to `n + 1` as the smallest possible window length is `1` and `n` is the length of the string.\n4. We initialize `left` to `0` as the starting point of the sliding window and `formed_chars` to `0` as the number of characters in the window that are part of the required characters.\n5. We iterate over the string using the `right` pointer.\n6. For each character at the `right` pointer, we decrement its frequency in the `char_freq_copy` map. If the frequency becomes `0`, we increment `formed_chars`.\n7. We then enter a while loop where we try to minimize the window length by moving the `left` pointer to the right.\n8. Inside the while loop, we check if the character at the `left` pointer is in the `char_freq_copy` map. If it is, we increment its frequency in the map and decrement `formed_chars` if its frequency becomes positive.\n9. We update `min_window_len` if the current window length is smaller than the minimum window length found so far.\n10. Finally, we return `min_window_len` if it's not equal to `n + 1` (which means we couldn't find a valid window), otherwise we return `0`.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(256.N) as we're iterating over the string once and using a frequency map to track the characters.\n\n**Auxiliary Space:** O(256) as we're using a frequency map to store the frequency of each character in the string."}, {"generated_text": "To find the smallest window length that contains all the characters of the given string at least one time, we can use the sliding window technique.

We start by initializing the `left` and `right` pointers to 0 and the `char_count` dictionary to store the count of each character in the string. We also initialize the `required_chars` count to the total number of unique characters in the string.\n\nWe then enter a loop where we keep moving the `right` pointer to the right. At each step, we add the character at the `right` pointer to the `char_count` dictionary and check if the count of the character is 1. If it is, we increment the `formed_chars` count.\n\nWe then enter another loop where we keep moving the `left` pointer to the right until the window size is less than the required characters or the `left` pointer is greater than the `right` pointer. At each step, we update the minimum window size, remove the character at the `left` pointer from the `char_count` dictionary, and decrement the `formed_chars` count.\n\nFinally, we return the minimum window size if it is not infinity."}, {"generated_text": "Here is the Python program that solves the problem using Python:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findSubString(self, str):\n        n = len(str)\n        char_count = {}\n        for char in str:\n            if char in char_count:\n                char_count[char] += 1\n            else:\n                char_count[char] = 1\n        \n        # Calculate the minimum window size\n        min_window_size = n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Try to minimize the window size\n            char_count_copy = char_count.copy()\n            window_size = 0\n            for j in range(i, n):\n                # If the character is in the window, decrement its count\n                if str[j] in char_count_copy:\n                    char_count_copy[str[j]] -= 1\n                    # If the count is zero, remove the character from the window\n                    if char_count_copy[str[j]] == 0:\n                        window_size += 1\n                # If all characters are in the window, update the minimum window size\n                if window_size == len(char_count):\n                    min_window_size = min(min_window_size, j - i + 1)\n        \n        return min_window_size\n```\n\nThis program uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in the string.

We first create a frequency dictionary `freq` to store the count of each character in the string.\n2.  Then we initialize `min_length` to `n + 1`, which will store the length of the smallest window that contains all the characters.\n3.  We iterate over the string using a sliding window of size `j - i + 1`, where `i` is the start of the window and `j` is the end.\n4.  Inside the loop, we maintain a set `unique_chars` to store the unique characters in the current window.\n5.  If the size of `unique_chars` equals the number of unique characters in the string (i.e., `len(freq)`), it means that the current window contains all the characters. We then update `min_length` with the minimum of the current `min_length` and the size of the window.\n6.  We break the inner loop as soon as we find a window that contains all the characters, since we are interested in the smallest such window.\n7.

First, we create a dictionary `char_count` to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n2.  We then create another dictionary `window_freq` to store the frequency of characters in the current window.\n3.  We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window. We start by expanding the window to the right by incrementing `right`.\n4.  When the window contains all the required characters (i.e., the characters that appear at least once in the string), we try to minimize the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right.\n5.  We keep track of the minimum window size and the corresponding substring.\n6.
