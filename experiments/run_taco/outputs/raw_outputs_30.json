{"id": 30, "input": "In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.\n\n\nYou may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,4], 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately. This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds. So you finally need to output 4.\n\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,2], 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status. Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. So you finally need to output 3.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nYou may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.\nYou may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.\nclass Solution:\n    def findPoisonedDuration(self, timeSeries: List[int], duration: int) -> int:\n        ", "difficulty": "MEDIUM_HARD", "generations": [{"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a simple Python function.

We initialize `totalTime` with 0 to keep track of the total time Ashe is in poisoned condition.\n2. We iterate over each time point in the `timeSeries`.\n3.

This is because the poisoning time duration for the current time point will overlap with the poisoning time duration for the next time point.\n5.

We initialize the `total_poisoned_time` variable to 0.\n2. We iterate over the `timeSeries` list, starting from the second element (index 1).\n3.

We first calculate the total time that Ashe would spend in poisoned condition if there was no overlap of poison status. This is done by multiplying the number of attacks by the duration of each poison status.\n\n2. However, since each poison status starts at the time of the attack and ends at the end of the attack, there is an overlap between poison statuses. To account for this, we subtract the time spent in poison status at the end of each interval.\n\n3. We use a generator expression to calculate the overlap time for each interval. For each interval, the overlap time is the duration of the poison status minus the time between the end of the previous poison status and the start of the current poison status.\n\n4. Finally, we return the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of attacks, and a space complexity of O(1), since we are only using a constant amount of space to store the total time and the overlap time for each interval."}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findPoisonedDuration(self, timeSeries: List[int], duration: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        This function calculates the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.\n\n        Args:\n        timeSeries (List[int]): A list of time points when Teemo attacks Ashe.\n        duration (int): The poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking.\n\n        Returns:\n        int: The total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        # Initialize the total poisoned time to 0\n        total_poisoned_time = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over the time series array\n        for i in range(len(timeSeries) - 1):\n            # For each time point, add the poisoning duration to the total poisoned time\n            # If it's the last time point, add the duration of the current time point\n            # because the poison will last until the end of this time point\n            total_poisoned_time += min(duration, timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i])\n        \n        # Add the duration of the last time point to the total poisoned time\n        # because the poison will last until the end of this time point\n        total_poisoned_time += min(duration, timeSeries[-1] - timeSeries[0] + duration)\n        \n        return total_poisoned_time\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the time series array and adding the poisoning duration to the total poisoned time for each time point.
