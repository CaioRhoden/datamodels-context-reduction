{"id": 37, "input": "There are n cities and n-1 two-way roads in Treeland. Each road connects a pair of different cities. From any city you can drive to any other, moving only along the roads. Cities are numbered from 1 to n. Yes, of course, you recognized an undirected tree in this description.\n\nThe government plans to repair all the roads. Each road will be repaired by some private company. In total, the country has 10^6 private companies that are numbered from 1 to 10^6. It is possible that some companies will not repair roads at all, and some will repair many roads.\n\nTo simplify the control over the work of private companies, the following restriction was introduced: for each city, we calculate the number of different companies that repair roads that have this city at one end. This number for each city should not exceed 2. In other words, for each city, there should be no more than two different companies that repair roads related to this city.\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Committee of Treeland raises concerns that all (or almost all) of the work will go to one private company. For this reason, the committee requires that roads be distributed among companies in such a way as to minimize the value of r. For each company, we calculate the number of roads assigned to it, the maximum among all companies is called the number r.\n\nHelp the government find such a way to distribute all roads among companies in the required way.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of input cases in the input. Next, the input cases themselves are given. The first line of each test case set contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 3000) \u2014 the number of cities in Treeland. Next, in the n-1 lines the roads are written: a line contains two integers x_i, y_i (1 \u2264 x_i, y_i \u2264 n), indicating that the i-th road connects the cities x_i and y_i.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all values n \u200b\u200bfor all test cases in the input does not exceed 3000.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answers for all t test cases in the input. Each test case must begin with a line that contains r \u2014 the minimum possible number of roads assigned to the most used company. Next, in the next line print n-1 the number c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n-1} (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 10^6), where c_i indicates the company to repair the i-th road.

We can then use a second DFS to assign roads to companies.\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef dfs(graph, node, parent, company):\n    children = set()\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:\n        if neighbor!= parent:\n            children.add(neighbor)\n            dfs(graph, neighbor, node, company)\n            company[neighbor] = company[node]\n            graph[node].remove(neighbor)\n            graph[neighbor].remove(node)\n    return children\n\ndef assign_roads(graph):\n    n = len(graph)\n    company = {}\n    result = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        children = dfs(graph, i, -1, company)\n        if len(children) == 0:\n            company[i] = 1\n            graph[i].append(i)\n        else:\n            for child in children:\n                company[child] = 2\n                graph[i].append(child)\n            mid = len(children) // 2\n            for j in range(mid):\n                company[children[j]] = 3\n                graph[children[j]].append(i)\n            if len(children) % 2 == 1:\n                company[children[mid]] = 1\n                graph[children[mid]].append(i)\n            for j in range(mid + 1, len(children)):\n                company[children[j]] = 4\n                graph[children[j]].append(i)\n        result.append(company[i])\n    \n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        for _ in range(n - 1):\n            x, y = map(int, input().split())\n            graph[x].append(y)\n            graph[y].append(x)\n        \n        result = assign_roads(graph)\n        r = max(result)\n        print(r)\n        print(*result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nThis solution works by first performing a DFS to traverse the tree and assign companies to each node. The company number of a node is determined by whether it is a child, a parent, or a sibling of another node with the same parent. The company number of a node is assigned as follows:\n\n- If a node is a child of a node, its company number is the same as its parent's company number.\n- If a node is a parent of multiple children, its company number is 2.\n- If a node is a parent of an odd number of children, its company number is 1, and the company number of the middle child is 1.\n- If a node is a parent of an even number of children, its company number is 3, and the company number of the two children at the ends are 3.\n\nThe company numbers are then used to construct the result, which is the minimum possible number of roads assigned to the most used company."}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python program to solve the problem using DFS and a disjoint set data structure to manage the tree structure of the cities and roads.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef dfs(node: int, parent: int, graph: List[List[int]], companies: List[int], visited: List[bool]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform DFS traversal from the given node and calculate the company ID for each child node.\n    \"\"\"\n    visited[node] = True\n    for child in graph[node]:\n        if child!= parent:\n            if not visited[child]:\n                company_id, _ = dfs(child, node, graph, companies, visited)\n                companies[node] = company_id\n            else:\n                companies[node] = companies[child]\n    return companies[node], len(graph[node])\n\ndef distribute_roads(graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Distribute the roads among companies to minimize the maximum number of roads assigned to any company.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(graph)\n    companies = [0] * n\n    visited = [False] * n\n    \n    # Assign company ID to each node using DFS\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            dfs(i, -1, graph, companies, visited)\n    \n    # Distribute roads among companies to minimize the maximum number of roads assigned to any company\n    max_roads = 0\n    road_count = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        road_count[companies[i]] += len(graph[i])\n        max_roads = max(max_roads, road_count[companies[i]])\n    \n    # If all roads are assigned to the same company, try to distribute them among two companies\n    if max_roads == n - 1:\n        for i in range(n):\n            road_count[companies[i]] = 1\n        max_roads = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            max_roads = max(max_roads, road_count[companies[i]])\n    \n    # Reassign roads to minimize the maximum number of roads assigned to any company\n    for i in range(n):\n        road_count[companies[i]] = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        road_count[companies[i]] += 1\n        if road_count[companies[i]] > max_roads // 2:\n            road_count[companies[i]] = max_roads // 2 + 1\n        else:\n            road_count[(companies[i] + 1) % n] += max_roads // 2 - road_count[companies[i]]\n    \n    # Create the output list\n    output = [0] * (n - 1)\n    company_index = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(len(graph[i])):\n            output[company_index] = companies[i]\n            company_index += 1\n    \n    return output, max_roads\n\n# Read the input\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, input().split())\n        graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)\n        graph[v - 1].append(u - 1)\n    \n    # Solve the problem\n    output, max_roads = distribute_roads(graph)\n    \n    # Print the output\n    print(max_roads)\n    print(*output)\n```\n\nThis program first assigns a company ID to each node using DFS.
