We first create a binary tree from the given array. We iterate through the array and for each node, we calculate its parent and child indices. If the child index is within the bounds of the array, we store the child value and its parent index in the array. Otherwise, we store `None` and the parent index.\n2.  We then perform level order traversal using a queue. We start by adding the root node to the queue. Then, we enter a loop where we dequeue nodes, add their children to the queue, and store their values in the result list. We sort the values at each level before adding them to the result list.\n3.

After processing all nodes at a level, the code sorts the nodes and adds them to the result list. Finally, the code returns the result list.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(NlogN), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree, because each node is dequeued and processed exactly once, and the sorting operation takes O(logN) time. The space complexity is O(N), because the code needs to store the nodes of each level in the result list.\n\nHere's an example usage of this code:\n\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\narr = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\nn = 7\nresult = solution.binTreeSortedLevels(arr, n)\nprint(result)  # Output: [[7], [5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4]]\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution using a binary tree and level order traversal with sorting:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def binTreeSortedLevels (self,arr, n):\n        # Create a binary tree\n        tree = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            tree.append(arr[i])\n\n        # Perform level order traversal and store levels in a list\n        levels = []\n        queue = deque([0])\n        while queue:\n            level = []\n            for _ in range(len(queue)):\n                node = queue.popleft()\n                level.append(tree[node])\n                if 2 * node + 1 < n:\n                    queue.append(2 * node + 1)\n                if 2 * node + 2 < n:\n                    queue.append(2 * node + 2)\n            levels.append(sorted(level))\n\n        return levels\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first create a binary tree from the given array.

If the queue has more than one node, we process the next level by popping nodes from the queue, sorting them, and adding them to the result. Finally, we process the last level.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(NlogN) because we perform sorting at each level, and the auxiliary space complexity is O(N) because we need to store nodes at each level in the queue.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\narr1 = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\nn1 = 7\nprint(solution.binTreeSortedLevels(arr1, n1))  # Output: [[7], [5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4]]\n\narr2 = [5, 6, 4, 9, 2, 1]\nn2 = 6\nprint(solution.binTreeSortedLevels(arr2, n2))  # Output: [[5], [4, 6], [1, 2, 9]]\n```"}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a level order traversal approach with a priority queue to store the nodes at each level. The priority queue will help us to get the nodes at each level in sorted order.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def binTreeSortedLevels (self,arr, n):\n        # Create a priority queue to store the nodes at each level\n        pq = []\n        \n        # Create a deque to store the nodes at the first level\n        queue = deque(arr[:2])\n        \n        # Push the nodes at the first level into the priority queue\n        for i in range(2):\n            if queue[i]: \n                heapq.heappush(pq, (0, queue[i]))\n        \n        # Initialize the result list\n        result = []\n        \n        # Process each level\n        level = 0\n        while pq:\n            # Get the nodes at the current level\n            level_nodes = []\n            for _ in range(len(pq)):\n                node = heapq.heappop(pq)\n                level_nodes.append(node[1])\n            \n            # Add the nodes at the current level to the result list\n            result.append(level_nodes)\n            \n            # Process the next level\n            level += 1\n            queue = deque([node[1] for node in pq if node[0] == level])\n            for node in queue:\n                if node: \n                    heapq.heappush(pq, (level, node))\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis code first creates a priority queue to store the nodes at each level. It then creates a deque to store the nodes at the first level and pushes them into the priority queue. The code then processes each level by popping the nodes from the priority queue, adding them to the result list, and pushing the nodes from the deque into the priority queue. The code repeats this process until all levels have been processed.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(NlogN) because each node is pushed and popped from the priority queue once, and the push and pop operations take O(logN) time. The auxiliary space complexity is O(N) because we need to store all nodes in the priority queue and the deque."}]}
