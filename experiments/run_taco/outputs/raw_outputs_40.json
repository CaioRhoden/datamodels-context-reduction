Later he realized that he doesn't like how the \u0410\u0421\u041c contests are organised: the team could only have three members (and he couldn't take all his friends to the competitions and distribute the tasks between the team members efficiently), so he decided to organize his own contests PFAST Inc. \u2014 Petr and Friends Are Solving Tasks Corporation. PFAST Inc. rules allow a team to have unlimited number of members.\n\nTo make this format of contests popular he organised his own tournament. To create the team he will prepare for the contest organised by the PFAST Inc. rules, he chose several volunteers (up to 16 people) and decided to compile a team from them. Petya understands perfectly that if a team has two people that don't get on well, then the team will perform poorly. Put together a team with as many players as possible given that all players should get on well with each other.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 16) \u2014 the number of volunteers, and m (<image>) \u2014 the number of pairs that do not get on. Next n lines contain the volunteers' names (each name is a non-empty string consisting of no more than 10 uppercase and/or lowercase Latin letters). Next m lines contain two names \u2014 the names of the volunteers who do not get on. The names in pair are separated with a single space. Each pair of volunteers who do not get on occurs exactly once. The strings are case-sensitive. All n names are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nThe first output line should contain the single number k \u2014 the number of people in the sought team. Next k lines should contain the names of the sought team's participants in the lexicographical order. If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them.

It then performs a depth-first search to find the largest clique in the graph, which corresponds to the largest team that can be formed.\n\nThe `team_formation` function takes the number of volunteers, the number of conflicts, the list of volunteers, and the list of conflicts as input. It creates an adjacency list representation of the graph, initializes a set to keep track of visited nodes, and a list to store the team members.\n\nThe `dfs` function is a recursive function that performs a depth-first search starting from a given node. It marks the node as visited, adds it to the team, and recursively searches its neighbors.\n\nThe `main` function reads the input, calls the `team_formation` function, and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\nThe code can be used to solve the problem for different inputs.

Each node in the graph represents a volunteer, and an edge between two nodes indicates that the corresponding volunteers don't get on. The program then performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the maximum number of volunteers that can form a team without any conflicts.\n\nThe `team_formation` function takes as input the number of volunteers, the number of pairs that don't get on, and the names of the volunteers and pairs that don't get on. It returns the maximum number of volunteers that can form a team without any conflicts.\n\nThe `dfs` function performs a DFS on the graph to find the maximum number of volunteers that can form a team starting from a given volunteer. It keeps track of the visited volunteers to avoid revisiting the same volunteer.\n\nIn the `main` function, the program reads the input from the user, calls the `team_formation` function to find the maximum number of volunteers that can form a team, and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\nThe program can be used to solve the team formation problem for different inputs. For example, if the input is:\n\n```\n3 1\nPetya\nVasya\nMasha\nPetya Vasya\n```\n\nThe program will output:\n\n```\n2\nMasha\nPetya\n```\n\nIf the input is:\n\n```\n3 0\nPasha\nLesha\nVanya\n```\n\nThe program will output:\n\n```\n3\nLesha\nPasha\nVanya\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution to the problem using a graph and a depth-first search (DFS) approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef find_team():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    names = {}\n    for i in range(n):\n        name = input().strip()\n        names[name] = i\n    pairs = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        pair = input().split()\n        pairs.append((names[pair[0]], names[pair[1]]))\n    \n    # Create a graph where each pair of conflicting names is an edge\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for pair in pairs:\n        graph[pair[0]].append(pair[1])\n        graph[pair[1]].append(pair[0])\n    \n    # Initialize a visited set and a result set\n    visited = set()\n    result = set()\n    \n    # Perform DFS to find the largest independent set\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i not in visited:\n            temp = set()\n            stack = deque([i])\n            while stack:\n                node = stack.pop()\n                if node not in visited:\n                    visited.add(node)\n                    temp.add(node)\n                    for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                        if neighbor not in visited:\n                            stack.append(neighbor)\n            if len(temp) > len(result):\n                result = temp\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(len(result))\n    for name in sorted(result):\n        print(list(names.keys())[name])\n\nfind_team()\n```\n\nThis program first reads the input, creating a dictionary of names and their corresponding indices.

It first reads the input and creates a graph with `n` nodes, where `n` is the number of volunteers. Then, it adds edges for each conflict between two volunteers.\n\nThe `bfs` method performs a breadth-first search on the graph starting from a given node. It returns the size of the largest connected component and the component itself.\n\nThe `solve` function iterates over all nodes in the graph and finds the largest connected component using the `bfs` method. It then prints the size of the largest connected component and the names of the volunteers in the component.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nThe code can be used to solve the problem for different inputs.

We initialize a `visited` array to keep track of the volunteers that have been added to the team, and a `queue` to perform BFS.\n3. We start by finding a volunteer who has not been visited yet (i.e., a team of size 1).\n4. We then perform BFS from this initial volunteer to find a team of size k. At each step, we add the volunteers that are connected to the current volunteer in the graph to the queue, and mark them as visited.\n5.
