{"id": 2, "input": "Little Petya likes to play a lot. Most of all he likes to play a game \u00abHoles\u00bb. This is a game for one person with following rules:\n\nThere are N holes located in a single row and numbered from left to right with numbers from 1 to N. Each hole has it's own power (hole number i has the power ai). If you throw a ball into hole i it will immediately jump to hole i + ai, then it will jump out of it and so on. If there is no hole with such number, the ball will just jump out of the row. On each of the M moves the player can perform one of two actions: \n\n  * Set the power of the hole a to value b. \n  * Throw a ball into the hole a and count the number of jumps of a ball before it jump out of the row and also write down the number of the hole from which it jumped out just before leaving the row. \n\n\n\nPetya is not good at math, so, as you have already guessed, you are to perform all computations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N and M (1 \u2264 N \u2264 105, 1 \u2264 M \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of holes in a row and the number of moves. The second line contains N positive integers not exceeding N \u2014 initial values of holes power. The following M lines describe moves made by Petya. Each of these line can be one of the two types: \n\n  * 0 a b\n  * 1 a\n\nType 0 means that it is required to set the power of hole a to b, and type 1 means that it is required to throw a ball into the a-th hole. Numbers a and b are positive integers do not exceeding N.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each move of the type 1 output two space-separated numbers on a separate line \u2014 the number of the last hole the ball visited before leaving the row and the number of jumps it made.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n8 5\n1 1 1 1 1 2 8 2\n1 1\n0 1 3\n1 1\n0 3 4\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n8 7\n8 5\n7 3\n", "difficulty": "VERY_HARD", "generations": [{"generated_text": "```python\nclass HolesGame:\n    def __init__(self, n, m, powers):\n        self.n = n\n        self.m = m\n        self.powers = powers\n        self.cache = [[0, 0] for _ in range(n)]\n\n    def set_power(self, hole, power):\n        self.powers[hole - 1] = power\n        self.cache[hole - 1] = [0, 0]\n\n    def throw_ball(self, hole):\n        if self.cache[hole - 1][0]!= 0:\n            return self.cache[hole - 1][1], self.cache[hole - 1][0]\n\n        jumps = 0\n        current_hole = hole\n        while current_hole <= self.n:\n            jumps += 1\n            new_hole = current_hole + self.powers[current_hole - 1] - 1\n            if new_hole > self.n:\n                break\n            current_hole = new_hole\n\n        self.cache[hole - 1] = [current_hole, jumps]\n        return current_hole, jumps\n\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    powers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    game = HolesGame(n, m, powers)\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        action, hole, power = 0, 0, 0\n        inputs = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        if len(inputs) == 3:\n            action, hole, power = inputs\n        else:\n            action, hole = inputs\n\n        if action == 0:\n            game.set_power(hole, power)\n        else:\n            last_hole, jumps = game.throw_ball(hole)\n            print(last_hole, jumps)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis Python program simulates the game \"Holes\" as described in the problem.

We will store the current state of the holes in a dictionary where the keys are the hole numbers and the values are the current powers of the holes. We will also store the history of jumps in a set to keep track of the last hole visited before leaving the row.\n\nHere is a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    holes = {i: int(input().split()[i-1]) for i in range(1, n+1)}\n    history = set()\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        query = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        if query[0] == 0:\n            holes[query[1]] = query[2]\n        else:\n            last_hole, jumps = jump(holes, query[1], set())\n            history.add((last_hole, jumps))\n            print(last_hole, jumps)\n\ndef jump(holes, start, visited):\n    if start + holes[start] > len(holes):\n        return start, 0\n    if start in visited:\n        return start, 0\n    visited.add(start)\n    return jump(holes, start + holes[start], visited)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `solve` that takes no arguments and solves the problem. It first reads the input, then enters a loop where it processes each query. If the query is of type 0, it updates the power of the hole. If the query is of type 1, it calls the `jump` function to simulate the jump and prints the result.\n\nThe `jump` function is a recursive function that simulates a single jump. It takes the current state of the holes, the current hole, and the set of visited holes as arguments. If the current hole is out of bounds or has been visited before, it returns the current hole and the number of jumps. Otherwise, it marks the current hole as visited, adds the power of the current hole to the current hole, and calls itself recursively.\n\nThe `solve` function uses a set `history` to keep track of the history of jumps. After simulating a jump, it adds the result to the history set. This is not necessary to solve the problem, but it can be useful for debugging purposes.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the input is well-formed and does not contain any errors. If the input can contain errors, you should add error checking code to handle them."}, {"generated_text": "```python\ndef compute_jumps(holes, moves):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the number of jumps and the last hole visited for each move.\n\n    Parameters:\n    holes (list): A list of initial hole powers.\n    moves (list): A list of moves.
