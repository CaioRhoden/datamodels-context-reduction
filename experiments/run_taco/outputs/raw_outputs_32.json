{"id": 32, "input": "Stewie the Rabbit explores a new parallel universe. This two dimensional universe has the shape of a rectangular grid, containing n lines and m columns. The universe is very small: one cell of the grid can only contain one particle. Each particle in this universe is either static or dynamic. Each static particle always remains in one and the same position. Due to unintelligible gravitation laws no two static particles in the parallel universe can be present in one column or row, and they also can't be present in the diagonally adjacent cells. A dynamic particle appears in a random empty cell, randomly chooses the destination cell (destination cell may coincide with the start cell, see the samples) and moves there along the shortest path through the cells, unoccupied by the static particles. All empty cells have the same probability of being selected as the beginning or end of the path. Having reached the destination cell, the particle disappears. Only one dynamic particle can exist at one moment of time. This particle can move from a cell to a cell if they have an adjacent side, and this transition takes exactly one galactic second. Stewie got interested in what is the average lifespan of one particle in the given universe.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers: n, m (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000) which represent the sizes of the universe. The next n lines containing m symbols each describe the universe without dynamic particles \u2014 the j-th symbol of the i-th line equals to 'X' if the cell is occupied by a static particle, and to '.' if it is empty. It is guaranteed that the described universe satisfies the properties described above, that is no two static particles can be in one column or in one row, besides, they can't be positioned in the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nOutput\n\nYou have to print on a single line a single number which is the average life span of a particle with an accuracy of at least 6 decimal places.\n\nThe answer will be accepted if it is within 10 - 6 of absolute or relative error from the correct answer.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 2\n..\n.X\n\n\nOutput\n\n0.888888888889\n\n\nInput\n\n3 3\n...\n.X.\n...\n\n\nOutput\n\n2.000000000000\n", "difficulty": "VERY_HARD", "generations": [{"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average lifespan of a particle in the given universe.

We first read the grid dimensions and the grid itself from the input.\n2.  We define a helper function `is_valid` to check if a cell is within the grid boundaries and is not occupied by a static particle.\n3.  We define another helper function `get_neighbors` to get all adjacent cells of a given cell.\n4.  We define a BFS function `bfs` to find the shortest path between the start and end cells. If the end cell is occupied by a static particle, we return the distance.\n5.  We define the main function `average_lifespan` to calculate the average lifespan of a dynamic particle in the grid. We iterate over all empty cells and for each cell, we calculate the total lifespan by summing up the lifespans of all possible pairs of cells.\n6.

It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\nThe `simulate` function simulates many particle movements and calculates the average distance traveled. It uses a random start and end position for each simulation, and calculates the shortest distance between these positions using the `calculate_distance` function.\n\nIn the `main` function, we first read the input grid and count the number of static particles. We then calculate the total number of possible start positions. We simulate many particle movements and calculate the average distance traveled, and finally calculate the average lifespan of a particle.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input grid is a rectangular grid with dimensions `n x m`, where `n` and `m` are integers.

It iterates over each empty cell in the grid, performs a BFS to find the shortest path to all other cells, and sums up the total lifespan.\n*   The `main` function reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself from the input, calls the `calculate_lifespan` function to calculate the average lifespan, and prints the result with six decimal places.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input grid is valid and satisfies the given conditions.

Dynamic particles can move from an empty cell to an adjacent empty cell, and their lifespan is the number of steps it takes to move from the starting cell to the destination cell.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo calculate the average lifespan of a particle, we can simulate the movement of particles from each empty cell to every other empty cell.

The static particles follow certain rules, and we need to find the average lifespan of a dynamic particle that moves through the grid.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_paths(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of paths from each cell to all other cells.\n    \n    Args:\n    grid (numpy.ndarray): A 2D grid representing the universe.\n    \n    Returns:\n    paths (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array containing the number of paths from each cell to all other cells.\n    \"\"\"\n    n, m = grid.shape\n    paths = np.zeros((n, m, n, m))\n    \n    # Initialize paths for cells that are not adjacent to any other cells\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i, j] == '.':\n                paths[i, j, i, j] = 1\n    \n    # Count the number of paths from each cell to all other cells\n    for k in range(n):\n        for l in range(m):\n            if grid[k, l] == '.':\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j in range(m):\n                        if grid[i, j] == '.' and abs(i - k) + abs(j - l) > 0:\n                            paths[i, j, k, l] = 1\n                            paths[k, l, i, j] = 1\n    \n    # Count the number of paths for each cell\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i, j] == '.':\n                for k in range(n):\n                    for l in range(m):\n                        if grid[k, l] == '.':\n                            paths[i, j, k, l] = int(paths[i, j, k, l]!= 0)\n    \n    return paths\n\ndef calculate_lifespan(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average lifespan of a particle in the grid universe.\n    \n    Args:\n    grid (numpy.ndarray): A 2D grid representing the universe.\n    \n    Returns:\n    lifespan (float): The average lifespan of a particle in the grid universe.\n    \"\"\"\n    n, m = grid.shape\n    paths = count_paths(grid)\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of paths from each cell to all other cells\n    total_paths = np.sum(paths, axis=(2, 3))\n    \n    # Calculate the probability of selecting each cell as the starting point\n    start_prob = np.sum(paths, axis=(0, 2)) / np.sum(paths)\n    \n    # Calculate the average lifespan of a particle\n    lifespan = np.sum(paths * (total_paths - 1)) / np.sum(start_prob * total_paths)\n    \n    return lifespan\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    grid = np.array([list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)])\n    \n    lifespan = calculate_lifespan(grid)\n    print(f\"{lifespan:.6f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\nThe code consists of three main functions:\n\n1. `count_paths(grid)`: This function counts the number of paths from each cell to all other cells in the grid universe. It uses a 4D numpy array to store the number of paths from each cell to all other cells.\n2. `calculate_lifespan(grid)`: This function calculates the average lifespan of a particle in the grid universe. It uses the `count_paths(grid)` function to count the number of paths from each cell to all other cells and then calculates the average lifespan using the probabilities of selecting each cell as the starting point.\n3. `main()`: This function reads the input grid from the user, calls the `calculate_lifespan(grid)` function to calculate the average lifespan, and prints the result.\n\nThe code uses a numpy array to represent the grid universe, which allows for efficient computation of the number of paths and the average lifespan.\n\nNote that the code assumes that the input grid is a rectangular grid with `n` lines and `m` columns, where each cell is either empty (`.`) or occupied by a static particle (`X`). The code also assumes that the static particles follow the rules specified in the problem statement."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average lifespan of a particle in the given universe.

It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path between two random empty cells. The average lifespan is then calculated by dividing the total lifespan by the number of simulations. The result is printed with an accuracy of at least 6 decimal places."}]}
