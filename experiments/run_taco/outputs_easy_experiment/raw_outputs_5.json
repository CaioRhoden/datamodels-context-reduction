The `main` function reads input from the standard input and outputs the result for each dataset.\n\nYou can save this code to a file, for example, `hamming_numbers.py`, and run it using the Python interpreter:\n\n```bash\npython hamming_numbers.py\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will read input from the standard input and output the result for each dataset. The input should be in the format specified in the problem statement, and the output will be the number of Hamming numbers within the given range for each dataset."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a technique called dynamic programming. The idea is to generate all possible Hamming numbers up to a certain limit and then count the ones that fall within the given range.\n\nHere is a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef generate_hamming_numbers(limit):\n    hamming_numbers = [1]\n    i2, i3, i5 = 0, 0, 0\n    while hamming_numbers[-1] < limit:\n        next_number = min(hamming_numbers[i2] * 2, hamming_numbers[i3] * 3, hamming_numbers[i5] * 5)\n        if next_number > limit:\n            break\n        hamming_numbers.append(next_number)\n        if next_number == hamming_numbers[i2] * 2:\n            i2 += 1\n        if next_number == hamming_numbers[i3] * 3:\n            i3 += 1\n        if next_number == hamming_numbers[i5] * 5:\n            i5 += 1\n    return hamming_numbers\n\ndef count_hamming_numbers(hamming_numbers, m, n):\n    return len([num for num in hamming_numbers if m <= num <= n])\n\ndef main():\n    limit = 1000000\n    hamming_numbers = generate_hamming_numbers(limit)\n    while True:\n        m, n = map(int, input().split())\n        if m == 0 and n == 0:\n            break\n        print(count_hamming_numbers(hamming_numbers, m, n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program first generates all possible Hamming numbers up to a certain limit (in this case, 1,000,000) and stores them in a list. Then, for each input dataset, it counts the number of Hamming numbers that fall within the given range and prints the result. The program stops when it encounters a dataset with both `m` and `n` equal to 0."}]}
