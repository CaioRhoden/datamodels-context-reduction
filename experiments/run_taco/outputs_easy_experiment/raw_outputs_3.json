Using this string of numeric values, you can predict how many years it will take before your dream comes true. Cut up the string into more than one segment and compare their values. The difference between the largest and smallest value will give you the number of years before your wish will be fulfilled. Therefore, the result varies depending on the way you cut up the string. For example, if you are given a string 11121314 and divide it into segments, say, as 1,11,21,3,14, then the difference between the largest and smallest is 21 - 1 = 20. Another division 11,12,13,14 produces 3 (i.e. 14 - 11) years. Any random division produces a game of luck.

It generates all possible ways of cutting the string using a loop, splits the string into segments, calculates the difference between the largest and smallest values, and updates the minimum difference.\n\nThe `itertools` module is not used in this solution because the problem does not require generating permutations or combinations. The loop is used instead to generate all possible ways of cutting the string.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of digits in the input string. This is because the loop iterates over all possible ways of cutting the string, and for each way, it calculates the difference between the largest and smallest values.\n\nThe space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input string. This is because the list of segments is stored in memory.\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\nThe following are example use cases of the `find_min_years` function:\n\n*   Input: `11121314`\n    Output: `3`\n*   Input: `123125129`\n    Output: `6`\n*   Input: `119138`\n    Output: `5`"}]}
