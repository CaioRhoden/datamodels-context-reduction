This is done by using a list comprehension to create a new matrix with toggled cells.\n3.  We calculate the score of the toggled matrix by summing up the binary numbers represented by each row. We use the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each cell in the row, and the `reversed` function to iterate over the cells from right to left (i.e., from the least significant bit to the most significant bit). We use the `2**i` expression to calculate the value of each bit, and the `sum` function to add up the values of all bits in each row.\n4.  In the `main` function, we read the size of the matrix and the matrix itself from the input, and then call the `max_score` function to calculate the maximum possible score.\n5.  Finally, we print the maximum possible score.\n\nExample use case:\n\nInput:\n\n```\n3 4\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n39\n```\n\nThis program solves the problem by toggling all rows and columns to get a matrix with all 1's, and then calculating the score of the toggled matrix by summing up the binary numbers represented by each row. The time complexity of this program is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively. The space complexity is also O(m \\* n), as we need to store the toggled matrix."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach.
