{"id": 30, "input": "In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.\n\n\nYou may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,4], 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately. This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds. So you finally need to output 4.\n\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,2], 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status. Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. So you finally need to output 3.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nYou may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.\nYou may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.\nclass Solution:\n    def findPoisonedDuration(self, timeSeries: List[int], duration: int) -> int:\n        ", "difficulty": "MEDIUM_HARD", "generations": [{"generated_text": "Here is a Python solution that uses the concept of summing up the durations of poisonings, excluding the overlap at the end of each poisoning duration.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findPoisonedDuration(self, timeSeries: List[int], duration: int) -> int:\n        # Handle the case when timeSeries is empty\n        if not timeSeries:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Initialize total time with the duration of the first poisoning\n        total_time = duration\n        \n        # Iterate over the time series starting from the second poisoning\n        for i in range(1, len(timeSeries)):\n            # If the current poisoning doesn't overlap with the previous one, add its duration to the total time\n            if timeSeries[i] > timeSeries[i - 1] + duration:\n                total_time += duration\n            # If the current poisoning overlaps with the previous one, add the non-overlapping part of its duration to the total time\n            else:\n                total_time += timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i - 1]\n        \n        # Return the total time\n        return total_time\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the time series and adding the duration of each poisoning to the total time, excluding the overlap at the end of each poisoning duration. If the current poisoning doesn't overlap with the previous one, we simply add its duration to the total time. If it overlaps, we add the non-overlapping part of its duration to the total time.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.findPoisonedDuration([1, 4], 2))  # Output: 4\nprint(solution.findPoisonedDuration([1, 2], 2))  # Output: 3\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here is the Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findPoisonedDuration(self, timeSeries: List[int], duration: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        This function calculates the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.\n        \n        Parameters:\n        timeSeries (List[int]): The ascending time series of Teemo's attacking towards Ashe.\n        duration (int): The poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking.\n        \n        Returns:\n        int: The total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        # Initialize the total time with 0\n        totalTime = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over the time series\n        for i in range(len(timeSeries) - 1):\n            # Add the duration of the current attack to the total time\n            totalTime += duration\n            \n            # If the next attack is not at the end of the duration, subtract the remaining time from the total time\n            if timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i] < duration:\n                totalTime -= (timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i])\n        \n        # Add the duration of the last attack to the total time\n        totalTime += duration\n        \n        # Return the total time\n        return totalTime\n```\n\nThis program uses a simple approach by iterating over the time series and adding the duration of each attack to the total time.
