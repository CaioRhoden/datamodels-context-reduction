Later he realized that he doesn't like how the \u0410\u0421\u041c contests are organised: the team could only have three members (and he couldn't take all his friends to the competitions and distribute the tasks between the team members efficiently), so he decided to organize his own contests PFAST Inc. \u2014 Petr and Friends Are Solving Tasks Corporation. PFAST Inc. rules allow a team to have unlimited number of members.\n\nTo make this format of contests popular he organised his own tournament. To create the team he will prepare for the contest organised by the PFAST Inc. rules, he chose several volunteers (up to 16 people) and decided to compile a team from them. Petya understands perfectly that if a team has two people that don't get on well, then the team will perform poorly. Put together a team with as many players as possible given that all players should get on well with each other.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 16) \u2014 the number of volunteers, and m (<image>) \u2014 the number of pairs that do not get on. Next n lines contain the volunteers' names (each name is a non-empty string consisting of no more than 10 uppercase and/or lowercase Latin letters). Next m lines contain two names \u2014 the names of the volunteers who do not get on. The names in pair are separated with a single space. Each pair of volunteers who do not get on occurs exactly once. The strings are case-sensitive. All n names are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nThe first output line should contain the single number k \u2014 the number of people in the sought team. Next k lines should contain the names of the sought team's participants in the lexicographical order. If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them.

Our task is to form a team with as many players as possible such that all players get along with each other.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem by using a graph data structure. Each volunteer will be a node in the graph, and two nodes will be connected by an edge if the corresponding volunteers do not get along.\n\nWe can use a disjoint set data structure to keep track of the connected components in the graph. The disjoint set data structure will allow us to efficiently check if two volunteers are in the same team.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nclass DisjointSet:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.parent = list(range(n))\n        self.rank = [0] * n\n\n    def find(self, x):\n        if self.parent[x]!= x:\n            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])\n        return self.parent[x]\n\n    def union(self, x, y):\n        x_root = self.find(x)\n        y_root = self.find(y)\n        if x_root!= y_root:\n            if self.rank[x_root] < self.rank[y_root]:\n                self.parent[x_root] = y_root\n            elif self.rank[x_root] > self.rank[y_root]:\n                self.parent[y_root] = x_root\n            else:\n                self.parent[y_root] = x_root\n                self.rank[x_root] += 1\n\n\ndef form_team(volunteers, pairs):\n    n = len(volunteers)\n    ds = DisjointSet(n)\n\n    for pair in pairs:\n        x, y = volunteers.index(pair[0]), volunteers.index(pair[1])\n        ds.union(x, y)\n\n    teams = {}\n    for i in range(n):\n        root = ds.find(i)\n        if root not in teams:\n            teams[root] = []\n        teams[root].append(volunteers[i])\n\n    max_size = 0\n    max_team = None\n    for team in teams.values():\n        if len(team) > max_size:\n            max_size = len(team)\n            max_team = team\n\n    return max_team\n\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    volunteers = [input() for _ in range(n)]\n    pairs = [input().split() for _ in range(m)]\n\n    team = form_team(volunteers, pairs)\n    print(len(team))\n    for member in sorted(team):\n        print(member)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code defines a `DisjointSet` class to implement the disjoint set data structure. The `find` method finds the root of a node, and the `union` method merges two connected components.\n\nThe `form_team` function takes the list of volunteers and pairs as input, and returns the largest team with no conflicts.\n\nIn the `main` function, we read the input from the user, form the largest team, and print the result.\n\nThis code has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of volunteers and m is the number of pairs. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of volunteers."}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef can_form_team(volunteers, conflicts):\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for conflict in conflicts:\n        graph[conflict[0]].append(conflict[1])\n        graph[conflict[1]].append(conflict[0])\n\n    visited = set()\n    team = set()\n    for volunteer in volunteers:\n        if volunteer not in visited:\n            can_add, team = dfs(volunteer, graph, visited, team)\n            if can_add:\n                break\n    return team\n\ndef dfs(volunteer, graph, visited, team):\n    visited.add(volunteer)\n    team.add(volunteer)\n    for conflict in graph[volunteer]:\n        if conflict not in visited:\n            can_add, team = dfs(conflict, graph, visited, team)\n            if not can_add:\n                team.remove(volunteer)\n                visited.remove(volunteer)\n                return False, team\n    return True, team\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    volunteers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        volunteers.append(input())\n    conflicts = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        conflicts.append(input().split())\n\n    team = can_form_team(volunteers, conflicts)\n    print(len(team))\n    for volunteer in sorted(team):\n        print(volunteer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses a graph to represent the conflicts between volunteers. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find a team of volunteers with no conflicts. If it finds a team, it prints the team. If it cannot find a team, it prints an empty team. The team is printed in lexicographical order.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n + m), where n is the number of volunteers and m is the number of conflicts. This is because it performs a DFS for each volunteer, and the DFS takes O(n + m) time.
