We initialize a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `n` to store the minimum sum of marks underwater on each day.\n2. We initialize `dp[0]` with the number of marks underwater on day 0, which is simply the number of marks on day 0.\n3. We iterate over the days from 1 to `n-1`. For each day `i`, we check if there are any marks above water on the current day. If not, the minimum sum of marks underwater is the same as the previous day.\n4. If there are marks above water on the current day, we calculate the number of marks that need to be underwater on the current day, which is the difference between the current day's marks and the previous day's marks (if any).\n5. We update `dp[i]` with the minimum of the current day's need and the previous day's sum.\n6. Finally, we return the minimum sum of marks underwater over all days by summing up the `dp` array.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n\n* Input: `6 0 1 0 3 0 2`, Output: `6`\n* Input: `5 0 1 2 1 2`, Output: `1`\n* Input: `5 0 1 1 2 2`, Output: `0`"}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the marks above the water level.
