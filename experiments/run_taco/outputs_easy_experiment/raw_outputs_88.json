The main idea is to sort the monsters by their coordinates and then iterate over them. For each monster, calculate the health decrease needed to bring its health to 0 or below. If the needed health decrease is greater than or equal to the bomb's health decrease, use a bomb to decrease the health of the current monster. Otherwise, decrease the health of the current monster directly.\n\nThe code uses a list of tuples to store the monster coordinates and healths, and it uses the `max` function to calculate the maximum health decrease needed for the current monster. The result (minimum number of bombs needed) is incremented whenever a bomb is used.\n\nThe `main` function reads the input from the standard input, calls the `min_bombs_needed` function to calculate the minimum number of bombs needed, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo use the provided code, save it to a file (e.g., `min_bombs_needed.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python min_bombs_needed.py`). The code will read the input from the standard input and print the minimum number of bombs needed to win.\n\nFor example, if the input is:\n```\n3 3 2\n1 2\n5 4\n9 2\n```\nThe code will output:\n```\n2\n```\nThis is the minimum number of bombs needed to win, as explained in the problem statement."}, {"generated_text": "Here is the Python solution to the given problem.

The left pointer starts at the beginning of the array and the right pointer starts at the beginning of the array as well. The program calculates the effective range of the bomb and the number of bombs needed to decrease the health of the monsters in the effective range. The program updates the result and moves the left pointer to the next monster. The program repeats this process until the right pointer is at the end of the array.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(N log N) due to the sorting of the monsters based on their x-coordinate.

The priority queue is sorted by the monster's x-coordinate. We iterate over the monsters and while the current monster's health is greater than the bomb's damage, we remove the monster that can be attacked by the current bomb from the priority queue. If the current monster's health is still greater than 0 after removing all monsters that can be attacked by the current bomb, we add the current monster to the priority queue and increment the minimum number of bombs.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N log N), where N is the number of monsters. This is because we are sorting the monsters by their x-coordinates and using a priority queue to keep track of the monsters that need to be attacked next.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of monsters.

It sorts the monsters by their x-coordinates and initializes a prefix sum array to store the total health of the monsters from the first monster to the current monster. The dynamic programming table `dp` stores the minimum number of bombs needed to win up to the current monster. For each monster, it finds the position where the last bomb should be dropped and calculates the remaining health after dropping a bomb. If the remaining health is non-negative, it updates the `dp` table.
