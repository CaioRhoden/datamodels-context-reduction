This is because we need to calculate `n!` modulo `MOD`, and we can do this in `O(log n)` time using modular exponentiation.\n- We then calculate `n!` modulo `MOD` using a loop. We start with `1` and multiply it by `(n - i + 1)` for `i` ranging from `1` to `k`. We take the modulo `MOD` at each step to prevent the result from getting too large.\n- We also calculate `r!` modulo `MOD` and `(n-r)!` modulo `MOD` using similar loops.\n- Finally, we calculate `nCr` modulo `MOD` using the formula `nCr = (n! * (r! * (n-r)!)^(-1)) % MOD`. We use the `pow` function to calculate `(r! * (n-r)!)^(-1)` modulo `MOD`.\n\nThis code has a time complexity of `O(m * log_{m}n)` and a space complexity of `O(m)`, where `m = 1000003`."}]}
