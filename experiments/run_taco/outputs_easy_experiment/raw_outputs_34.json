This would reduce the time complexity to O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\nHere is an even more optimized version of the program that uses a hash table to store the frequencies of the substrings:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_anagramic_pairs(s):\n    # Initialize a hash table to store the frequencies of the substrings\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    # Initialize a variable to store the total number of anagramic pairs\n    total_pairs = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible substrings of the given string\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):\n            # Extract the current substring\n            substring = s[i:j]\n            \n            # Sort the characters in the substring to create a key for the hash table\n            key = ''.join(sorted(substring))\n            \n            # Increment the frequency of the substring\n            freq[key] += 1\n    \n    # Iterate over each frequency in the hash table\n    for value in freq.values():\n        # For each frequency, the number of anagramic pairs is given by n*(n-1)//2 where n is the frequency\n        total_pairs += value * (value - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Return the total number of anagramic pairs\n    return total_pairs\n\n# Read the number of strings\nT = int(input())\n\n# Iterate over each string\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read the string\n    s = input()\n    \n    # Calculate and print the total number of anagramic pairs\n    print(count_anagramic_pairs(s))\n```\n\nThis version of the program has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the use of a hash table to store the frequencies of the substrings. This makes it much more efficient than the previous versions for large inputs.\n\nHowever, if the input strings are extremely large, a more efficient approach would be to use a suffix tree or a suffix array to store the substrings and their frequencies.

It first reads the number of strings `T` from the input.\n2.  It then reads each string and calculates the number of anagramic pairs using the `anagramic_pairs` function.\n3.  The `anagramic_pairs` function generates all possible substrings of the input string, sorts the characters in each substring to create a unique key, and stores the frequency of each key in a hash map.\n4.  If the frequency of a key is greater than 1, it means we have found an anagramic pair, and we increment the total count of anagramic pairs.\n5.  Finally, the program prints the total count of anagramic pairs for each string."}]}
