We can improve this by using a counter-based approach, which has a time complexity of O(n).\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef is_anagram(test, original):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n    Args:\n    test (str): The string to check.\n    original (str): The original string to compare against.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert both strings to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive\n    test = test.lower()\n    original = original.lower()\n\n    # Create a counter for each string\n    test_counter = Counter(test)\n    original_counter = Counter(original)\n\n    # Compare the counters\n    return test_counter == original_counter\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_anagram(\"foefet\", \"toffee\"))  # Output: True\nprint(is_anagram(\"Buckethead\", \"DeathCubeK\"))  # Output: True\nprint(is_anagram(\"hello\", \"world\"))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis version of the function works by creating a counter for each string, which is a dictionary-like object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string. It then compares the two counters, returning `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. This approach is more efficient than the sorting approach, especially for large strings."}, {"generated_text": "Here's the Python function to check if two words are anagrams of each other:\n\n```python\ndef is_anagram(test, original):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two words are anagrams of each other.\n    \n    Args:\n    test (str): The word to check.\n    original (str): The original word.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the words are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert both words to lower case to make the comparison case insensitive\n    test = test.lower()\n    original = original.lower()\n    \n    # Sort the characters in each word and compare the results\n    return sorted(test) == sorted(original)\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `test` and `original`.\n2. It converts both words to lower case using the `lower()` method, so the comparison is case insensitive.\n3. It sorts the characters in each word using the `sorted()` function and compares the results.\n4.

We convert both input strings to lowercase using the `lower()` method, so that the comparison is case-insensitive.\n2. We sort the characters in each string using the `sorted()` function.
