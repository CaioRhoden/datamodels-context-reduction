We update `min_val` as the minimum of the current `min_val` and `a[i]`.\n6.  We store the updated `total_operations` in `min_operations[i]`.\n7.  Finally, we return the `min_operations` array.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n)\n\n**Auxiliary Space:** O(1)\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   1 <= N <= 10^6\n*   -10^5 <= A[i] <= 10^5\n*   Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10^6."}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution for the problem. The idea is to maintain a running total of the minimum number of operations required to make all elements up to each index equal to the median of the subarray. \n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def optimalArray(self, n: int, a: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        result = [0] * n\n        \n        # Calculate prefix sum and count of elements less than or equal to each element\n        count = 0\n        left_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            left_sum += i\n            count += 1 if a[i] <= a[0] else 0\n            \n            # If count is more than n/2, it means median will be on right side\n            if count > n // 2:\n                median = a[i]\n                for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                    # Update result for j and add difference between a[j] and median to left_sum\n                    result[j] = left_sum + (a[j] - median)\n                    left_sum -= j\n                break\n        \n        # If we didn't break above, it means median is on left side\n        else:\n            median = a[0]\n            for i in range(n):\n                # Update result for i and add difference between a[i] and median to left_sum\n                result[i] = left_sum + (a[i] - median)\n                left_sum += i\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution works in O(n) time complexity and uses O(1) auxiliary space. It maintains a running total of the minimum number of operations required to make all elements up to each index equal to the median of the subarray. The median is calculated by counting the number of elements less than or equal to each element and updating the median accordingly. The result is updated for each index and the running total is maintained."}]}
