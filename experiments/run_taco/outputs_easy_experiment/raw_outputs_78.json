The `prefix_sum` function calculates the prefix sum of the input array. The prefix sum is an array where each element is the sum of all elements in the input array up to that index.\n2.  The `query` function calculates the number of subarrays that satisfy the condition for a given value `K`. It does this by iterating over the prefix sum array and counting the number of subarrays that have a sum greater than or equal to `K`.\n3.  In the `main` function, we read the size of the array, the array itself, and the number of queries.\n4.  We then process each query by reading the value `K` and calling the `query` function to calculate the result.\n\nNote that this program has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the size of the array.

The `foo` function returns the minimum of all elements in the array.\n2. The `solve` function reads the size of the array and the array elements, and then reads the number of queries.\n3. It creates a list `cum_sum` to store the cumulative sum of the array. Each element in `cum_sum` represents the number of subarrays ending at that index with the minimum element equal to the current element.\n4. For each query, it uses binary search to find the first index `idx` such that `arr[idx] >= k`.\n5. The number of subarrays with the minimum element equal to `k` is then calculated as `cum_sum[n] - cum_sum[idx] + (cum_sum[idx] - cum_sum[idx - 1] if idx > 0 else 0)`. This is because the cumulative sum `cum_sum[idx]` includes all subarrays ending at index `idx`, and we need to subtract the cumulative sum `cum_sum[idx - 1]` if `idx > 0` to exclude the subarrays ending at index `idx - 1` that have the minimum element equal to `arr[idx - 1]`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(q \\* n log n) due to the binary search, where n is the size of the array and q is the number of queries.
