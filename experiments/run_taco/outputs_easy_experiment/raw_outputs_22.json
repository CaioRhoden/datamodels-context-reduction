The idea is to use a queue to store the nodes at each level, and then use a heap to get the nodes in sorted order at each level.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def binTreeSortedLevels(self, arr, n):\n        # Create a queue to store nodes at each level\n        queue = deque(arr[:2])\n        arr = arr[2:]\n        n -= 2\n        result = []\n        \n        # Process levels\n        while queue:\n            # Get the nodes at the current level\n            level = []\n            for _ in range(len(queue)):\n                node = queue.popleft()\n                level.append(node)\n                \n                # Add the children of the node to the queue\n                if n > 0:\n                    queue.append(arr[0])\n                    queue.append(arr[1])\n                    arr = arr[2:]\n                    n -= 2\n                    \n            # Sort the nodes at the current level\n            level.sort()\n            \n            # Add the sorted nodes to the result\n            result.append(level)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first process the first two nodes as they are the root of the tree. Then we enter a loop where we process each level of the tree. At each level, we get the nodes from the queue, add their children to the queue, and sort the nodes. Finally, we add the sorted nodes to the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(NlogN) as we are sorting the nodes at each level. The auxiliary space complexity is O(N) as we are storing the nodes at each level in the queue and the result.\n\nNote: The above code assumes that the input array `arr` contains the data of N nodes of Complete Binary tree in level order fashion. If the input array contains the data in any other order, the code may need to be modified accordingly."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use a level order traversal approach along with a heap data structure. The idea is to first create a min-heap from the given array. Then, we perform the level order traversal by popping the root of the heap and adding the popped element to the result list. For each popped element, we add its children to the heap. We repeat this process until the heap is empty.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass Solution:\n    def binTreeSortedLevels(self, arr, n):\n        # Create a min-heap\n        min_heap = []\n        for num in arr:\n            heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)\n        \n        result = []\n        level = []\n        \n        # Perform level order traversal\n        while min_heap:\n            level = []\n            for _ in range(len(min_heap)):\n                node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)\n                level.append(node)\n            \n            # Sort the level and add it to the result\n            level.sort()\n            result.append(level)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis code works as follows:\n\n1.  We create a min-heap from the given array `arr`. This is done by iterating over the array and pushing each element into the heap using `heapq.heappush`.\n2.  We initialize an empty list `result` to store the level order traversal in sorted order.\n3.  We iterate over the heap until it is empty. In each iteration, we pop the root of the heap (the smallest element) and add it to the current level `level`.\n4.  We repeat the process of popping elements from the heap and adding them to the current level until the level is full (i.e., until the heap is empty).\n5.  After processing each level, we sort the level in ascending order using `level.sort()` and add it to the result list `result`.\n6.  Finally, we return the result list, which contains the level order traversal in sorted order.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N log N) because we perform a heap operation (push or pop) for each element in the array. The auxiliary space complexity is O(N) because we need to store the elements of the array in the heap.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\narr = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\nn = 7\nprint(solution.binTreeSortedLevels(arr, n))\n# Output: [[7], [5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4]]\n\narr = [5, 6, 4, 9, 2, 1]\nn = 6\nprint(solution.binTreeSortedLevels(arr, n))\n# Output: [[5], [4, 6], [1, 2, 9]]\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution that uses a queue for level order traversal and sorting each level separately.

The sorted nodes at each level are appended to the result list.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(NlogN) due to the sorting operation at each level, and the auxiliary space complexity is O(N) for storing the binary tree nodes."}, {"generated_text": "Here is the solution to the problem using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def binTreeSortedLevels (self,arr, n):\n        # Create a new binary tree\n        root = self.create_tree(arr, n)\n        \n        # Initialize the result and queue\n        result = []\n        queue = deque()\n        \n        # Add the root to the queue\n        queue.append(root)\n        \n        while queue:\n            # Get the size of the current level\n            level_size = len(queue)\n            \n            # Initialize the level array\n            level = []\n            \n            # Process all nodes in the current level\n            for _ in range(level_size):\n                # Dequeue a node\n                node = queue.popleft()\n                \n                # Add the node's value to the level array\n                level.append(node.val)\n                \n                # Add the node's children to the queue\n                if node.left:\n                    queue.append(node.left)\n                if node.right:\n                    queue.append(node.right)\n            \n            # Sort the level array and add it to the result\n            result.append(sorted(level))\n        \n        return result\n    \n    def create_tree(self, arr, n):\n        # Create a new binary tree\n        nodes = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            nodes.append(Node(arr[i]))\n        \n        # Build the binary tree\n        for i in range(n):\n            if i * 2 + 1 < n:\n                nodes[i].left = nodes[i * 2 + 1]\n            if i * 2 + 2 < n:\n                nodes[i].right = nodes[i * 2 + 2]\n        \n        return nodes[0]\n    \nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n```\n\nThis code creates a new binary tree from the given array, performs level order traversal, and returns the levels in sorted order.\n\nThe `create_tree` method creates a new binary tree by iterating over the array and assigning children to each node based on the array's indices.\n\nThe `binTreeSortedLevels` method performs level order traversal, sorting each level array before adding it to the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(NlogN) due to the sorting operation in each level, and the auxiliary space complexity is O(N) for storing the nodes in the queue."}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python solution for the given problem using a level order traversal approach combined with sorting at each level.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def binTreeSortedLevels (self,arr, n):\n        # Initialize the queue with the root node\n        queue = deque()\n        \n        # Perform level order traversal\n        result = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Add the current node to the queue\n            queue.append(arr[i])\n            \n            # If the queue is not empty, process the next level\n            if len(queue) > 1:\n                level = []\n                for _ in range(len(queue)):\n                    # Dequeue the next node and add it to the current level\n                    node = queue.popleft()\n                    level.append(node)\n                    \n                    # Add the children of the dequeued node to the queue\n                    if i * 2 + 1 < n:\n                        queue.append(arr[i * 2 + 1])\n                    if i * 2 + 2 < n:\n                        queue.append(arr[i * 2 + 2])\n                \n                # Sort the current level and add it to the result\n                level.sort()\n                result.append(level)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution works by maintaining a queue of nodes at each level. It iterates over the array, adding each node to the queue and processing the next level when the queue has at least two nodes. At each level, it dequeues the nodes, adds them to the current level, and sorts the level before adding it to the result.\n\nThe time complexity is O(NlogN) due to the sorting at each level, where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
