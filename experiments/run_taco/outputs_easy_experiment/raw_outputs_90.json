The `levenshtein_distance` function calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings. The `distance_between_substrings` function uses the `levenshtein_distance` function to calculate the distance between substrings of `s` and `t`.\n\nIn the `distance_between_substrings` function, we first count the occurrences of each character in `t`. Then, for each substring of `s` with the same length as `t`, we count the occurrences of each character in this substring and calculate the distance as the sum of absolute differences between these counts and the corresponding counts in `t`.\n\nThe result is printed as a space-separated list of integers."}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python program that will solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef min_distance(s, t):\n    n, m = len(s), len(t)\n    char_count = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for c in t:\n        char_count[c] += 1\n\n    operations = 0\n    for i in range(n - m + 1):\n        substring = s[i:i+m]\n        temp_count = defaultdict(int)\n        for c in substring:\n            temp_count[c] += 1\n        for c in t:\n            operations += abs(temp_count[c] - char_count[c])\n        print(operations, end=' ')\n        for c in substring:\n            temp_count[c] -= 1\n        operations -= abs(temp_count[s[i]] - char_count[s[i]])\n\ns = input()\nt = input()\nmin_distance(s, t)\n```\n\nThis program works by iterating over all substrings of the string `s` of length `m` (the length of the string `t`). For each substring, it counts the occurrences of each character in both the substring and the string `t`. The difference in these counts is the number of operations needed to transform the substring into the string `t`. The program then prints this number of operations for each substring.\n\nNote: The `defaultdict` from the `collections` module is used to automatically create a dictionary entry when a key is not present in the dictionary. This simplifies the code and makes it more efficient.\n\nAlso, the `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between the counts of each character in the substring and the string `t`. This is because the distance between two strings is the minimum number of operations needed to transform one into the other, regardless of the order in which the operations are performed.\n\nFinally, the program uses the `end=' '` argument to the `print` function to print all the distances on the same line, separated by spaces.
