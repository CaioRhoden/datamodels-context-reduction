It then initializes a variable to keep track of the number of good years.\n\nIt then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '1', it increments the good years count.\n\nAfter that, it checks if the number of good years is greater than or equal to 50% of the total years. If it is, it prints \"YES\". Otherwise, it checks if any substring of the string has 50% or more good years.\n\nIf any substring has 50% or more good years, it prints \"YES\". If no such substring exists, it prints \"NO\"."}, {"generated_text": "Here is the Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\ndef can_go_to_heaven(L, S):\n    # Calculate the total number of good years\n    good_years = S.count('1')\n    \n    # Check if Chef can go to heaven by living the full life\n    if good_years >= L // 2:\n        return \"YES\"\n    \n    # Check if Chef can go to heaven by living a shorter life\n    for L_prime in range(L, 0, -1):\n        if S[:L_prime].count('1') >= L_prime // 2:\n            return \"YES\"\n    \n    # If no way to go to heaven, return \"NO\"\n    return \"NO\"\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n\n# Run the test cases\nfor _ in range(T):\n    L = int(input())\n    S = input()\n    print(can_go_to_heaven(L, S))\n```\n\nThis solution first checks if the Chef can go to heaven by living the full life.
