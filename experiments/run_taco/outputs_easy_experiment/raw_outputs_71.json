{"id": 71, "input": "A gene is represented as a string of length $n$ (where $n$ is divisible by $4$), composed of the letters $\\mbox{A}$, $\\mbox{C}$, $\\textbf{T}$, and $\\mbox{G}$.\nIt is considered to be steady if each of the four letters occurs exactly $\\frac{n}{4}$ times.  For example, $\\textbf{GACT}$ and $\\textbf{AAGTGCCT}$ are both steady genes.\n\nBear Limak is a famous biotechnology scientist who specializes in modifying bear DNA to make it steady.  Right now, he is examining a gene represented as a string $\\textit{gene}$.  It is not necessarily steady.  Fortunately, Limak can choose one (maybe empty) substring of $\\textit{gene}$ and replace it with any string of the same length.\n\nModifying a large substring of bear genes can be dangerous.\nGiven a string $\\textit{gene}$, can you help Limak find the length of the smallest possible substring that he can replace to make $\\textit{gene}$ a steady gene?\n\nNote: A substring of a string $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{~S~}}$ is a subsequence made up of zero or more contiguous characters of $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{~S~}}$.\n\nAs an example, consider $\\textit{gene}=\\textit{ACTGAAAG}$.  The substring $\\boldsymbol{AA}$ just before or after $\\mbox{G}$ can be replaced with $\\textit{CT}$ or $\\boldsymbol{TC}$.
