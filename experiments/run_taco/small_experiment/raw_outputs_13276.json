Since the array is now sorted, the index of each element corresponds to its position in the reduced form (from 0 to N-1).\n\nThis solution meets the expected time complexity of O(N*logN) due to the sorting operation and the expected auxiliary space of O(N) because we are modifying the input array in-place.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\narr = [10, 40, 20]\nn = 3\nsolution.convert(arr, n)\nprint(arr)  # Output: [0, 2, 1]\n\narr = [5, 10, 40, 30, 20]\nn = 5\nsolution.convert(arr, n)\nprint(arr)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 3, 2]\n```\n\nNote that this solution modifies the input array in-place and does not return anything."}, {"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of counting sort.
