The `total_tyres` function takes two arguments: `N` (number of bikes) and `M` (number of cars).\n2. It calculates the total number of tyres by multiplying the number of bikes by 2 (each bike has 2 tyres) and the number of cars by 4 (each car has 4 tyres).\n3. The results are added together to get the total number of tyres.\n4. The program reads the number of test cases `T` from the input.\n5. For each test case, it reads the number of bikes `N` and cars `M` from the input.\n6. It calls the `total_tyres` function with these values and prints the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n* Input: `2 1`\n  Output: `8`\n* Input: `3 0`\n  Output: `6`\n* Input: `1 2`\n  Output: `12`"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the total number of tyres\ndef calculate_tyres(N, M):\n    # Each bike has 2 tyres\n    bike_tyres = N * 2\n    \n    # Each car has 4 tyres\n    car_tyres = M * 4\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of tyres\n    total_tyres = bike_tyres + car_tyres\n    \n    return total_tyres\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n\n# Process each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read the number of bikes and cars\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # Calculate and print the total number of tyres\n    total_tyres = calculate_tyres(N, M)\n    print(total_tyres)\n```\n\nHere's how the code works:\n\n1. The `calculate_tyres` function takes the number of bikes (`N`) and cars (`M`) as input and returns the total number of tyres.\n2. The function calculates the number of bike tyres by multiplying the number of bikes by 2, and the number of car tyres by multiplying the number of cars by 4.\n3. The total number of tyres is then calculated by adding the number of bike tyres and car tyres.\n4. The main part of the code reads the number of test cases (`T`) from the input.\n5.

It first reads the number of test cases, then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of bikes and cars, calculates the total number of tyres by multiplying the number of bikes by 2 and the number of cars by 4, and finally prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Input:\n    ```\n2\n2 1\n3 0\n```\n    Output:\n    ```\n8\n6\n```\n*   Input:\n    ```\n1\n5 2\n```\n    Output:\n    ```\n18```\n\nThis program can handle any number of test cases and any valid input values for the number of bikes and cars. The time complexity is O(t \\* n + t \\* m), where t is the number of test cases, n is the number of bikes, and m is the number of cars. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output values."}]}
