{"id": 24970, "input": "Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l \u2014 left, s \u2014 straight, r \u2014 right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] \n\nAn accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.\n\nNow, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.\n\nEach line contains four integers l, s, r, p \u2014 for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn a single line, print \"YES\" if an accident is possible, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.\n\nIn the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light.

The `is_accident_possible` function takes a list of lists `lights` as input, where each sublist represents the lights of a road part.\n2. The function uses two nested loops to check all possible combinations of green lights. The outer loop iterates over the four road parts, and the inner loop iterates over the four road parts again.\n3. Inside the inner loop, the function checks if the pedestrian light of the current part is green (`lights[i][3] == 1`) and if at least one of the lane lights of the other part is green (`lights[j][:3].count(1) > 0`).\n4. If the function finds a combination that meets these conditions, it returns \"YES\".\n5. If the function checks all combinations without finding a match, it returns \"NO\".\n\nYou can run this program by copying and pasting it into a Python interpreter, then entering the input for the four road parts when prompted. The program will print \"YES\" if an accident is possible and \"NO\" otherwise."}]}
