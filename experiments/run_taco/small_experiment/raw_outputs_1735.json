We define a function `min_moves_to_recolor` that takes an image string as input and returns the minimum number of moves required to recolor all pixels into the same color.\n2.  We count the number of different colors in the image by converting the image string to a set of unique characters.\n3.  We calculate the minimum number of moves required based on the number of different colors:\n    *   If there is only one color, no moves are required.\n    *   If there are two colors, one move is required.\n    *   If there are more than two colors, the minimum number of moves is `num_colors - 1`.\n4.  We read the number of test cases and process each test case by reading the image, calculating the minimum number of moves required using the `min_moves_to_recolor` function, and printing the result."}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python program that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_moves(s1, s2):\n    colors = set(s1 + s2)\n    max_color_count = max(s1.count(c) + s2.count(c) for c in colors)\n    return max(0, 4 - max_color_count)\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    s1 = input()\n    s2 = input()\n    print(min_moves(s1, s2))\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n- It defines a function `min_moves` that takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input.\n- It creates a set of unique colors in the image by concatenating `s1` and `s2`.\n- It counts the maximum number of pixels of the same color by summing the counts of each color in `s1` and `s2`.\n- It returns the minimum number of moves required to paint all pixels the same color, which is the maximum of 0 and 4 minus the maximum color count.\n- It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading two strings `s1` and `s2` and printing the result of `min_moves(s1, s2)`.\n\nThis program runs in O(n) time, where n is the total number of pixels in the image, since it needs to iterate over each pixel once to count the colors.
