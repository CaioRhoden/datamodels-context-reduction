The rules of the game are as follows: those who play for the first time, that is Vasya is the sleuth, he should investigate a \"crime\" and find out what is happening. He can ask any questions whatsoever that can be answered with \"Yes\" or \"No\". All the rest agree beforehand to answer the questions like that: if the question\u2019s last letter is a vowel, they answer \"Yes\" and if the last letter is a consonant, they answer \"No\". Of course, the sleuth knows nothing about it and his task is to understand that.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is not very smart. After 5 hours of endless stupid questions everybody except Vasya got bored. That\u2019s why Vasya\u2019s friends ask you to write a program that would give answers instead of them.\n\nThe English alphabet vowels are: A, E, I, O, U, Y\n\nThe English alphabet consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Z\n\nInput\n\nThe single line contains a question represented by a non-empty line consisting of large and small Latin letters, spaces and a question mark. The line length does not exceed 100. It is guaranteed that the question mark occurs exactly once in the line \u2014 as the last symbol and that the line contains at least one letter.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint answer for the question in a single line: YES if the answer is \"Yes\", NO if the answer is \"No\".\n\nRemember that in the reply to the question the last letter, not the last character counts. I. e. the spaces and the question mark do not count as letters.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\nIs it a melon?\n\n\nOutput\n\nNO\n\n\nInput\n\nIs it an apple?\n\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n\n\nInput\n\n  Is     it a banana ?\n\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n\n\nInput\n\nIs   it an apple  and a  banana   simultaneouSLY?\n\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n", "difficulty": "EASY", "generations": [{"generated_text": "Here is a Python program that solves the problem:\n```python\ndef get_answer(question):\n    # Remove spaces and the question mark\n    question = question.replace(\" \", \"\").replace(\"?\", \"\")\n\n    # Check if the last character is a vowel\n    last_char = question[-1].upper()\n    if last_char in \"AEIOUY\":\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read the question from the input\nquestion = input()\n\n# Print the answer\nprint(get_answer(question))\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1.
