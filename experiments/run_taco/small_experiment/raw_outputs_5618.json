Rolls are made by a newly invented cooking machine. The machine is pretty universal - it can make lots of dishes and Chefza is thrilled about this.\nTo make a roll, Chefza has to set all the settings to specified integer values. There are lots of settings, each of them set to some initial value. The machine is pretty complex and there is a lot of cooking to be done today, so Chefza has decided to use only two quick ways to change the settings. In a unit of time, he can pick one setting (let's say its current value is v) and change it in one of the following ways.\n\nIf v is even, change this setting to v/2. If v is odd, change it to (v \u2212 1)/2.\nChange setting to 2 \u00d7 v\n\nThe receipt is given as a list of integer values the settings should be set to. It is guaranteed that each destination setting can be represented as an integer power of 2.\nSince Chefza has just changed his profession, he has a lot of other things to do. Please help him find the minimum number of operations needed to set up a particular setting of the machine. You can prove that it can be done in finite time.\n\n------ Input ------ \n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers A and B denoting the initial and desired values of the setting, respectively.\n\n------ Output ------ \n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing minimum number of operations Chefza has to perform in order to set up the machine.\n\n------ Constraints ------ \n\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 200$\n$1 \u2264 A \u2264 10^{7}$\n$1 \u2264 B \u2264 10^{7}, and B is an integer power of 2$\n\n------ Subtasks ------ \n\n$Subtask #1 [40 points]: A \u2264 100 and B \u2264 100$\n$Subtask #2 [60 points]: No additional constraints$\n\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \n6\n1 1\n2 4\n3 8\n4 16\n4 1\n1 4\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \n0\n1\n4\n2\n2\n2\n----- explanation 1 ------ \n\nIn the first test case, you don't need to do anything.\nIn the second test case, you need to multiply 2 by 2 and get 4. This is done in 1 operation.\nIn the third test case, you need to obtain 1 from 3 and then multiply it by 2 three times to obtain 8. A total of 4 operations.\nIn the fourth test case, multiply 4 by 2 twice.\nIn the fifth test case, divide 4 by 2 twice.\nIn the sixth test case, multiply 1 by 2 twice.\n", "difficulty": "EASY", "generations": [{"generated_text": "### Problem Solution: Minimum Operations to Set Up the Machine\n\nWe can solve this problem using a simple iterative approach.

The function uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the operations until the initial value reaches the target value. The main function reads the input, calls the `min_operations` function for each test case, and prints the result.\n\nNote that the `min_operations` function has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the target value. This is because the number of operations is proportional to the number of times we can divide the initial value by 2"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef min_operations(A, B):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of operations to set up the machine.\n\n    Args:\n        A (int): The initial value of the setting.\n        B (int): The desired value of the setting.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert A to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n    bin_A = bin(A)[2:]\n    \n    # Initialize the count of operations\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the binary representation of A\n    for i in range(len(bin_A) - 1, -1, -1):\n        # If the current bit is 1, increment the count\n        if bin_A[i] == '1':\n            count += 1\n            # If the current bit is 1, we need to flip it to 0\n            # We can do this by subtracting 1 from the current value\n            A -= 2 ** (len(bin_A) - 1 - i)\n    \n    # If A is not equal to B, we need to add the difference to the count\n    if A!= B:\n        count += math.ceil(math.log2(B / A))\n    \n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    \n    # Process each test case\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the initial and desired values\n        A, B = map(int,"}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python program that reads the problem statement in Mandarin Chinese and Russian, and solves the problem.\n\n```python\ndef min_operations(A, B):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of operations to set up the machine.\n\n    Args:\n    A (int): The initial value of the setting.\n    B (int): The desired value of the setting.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The minimum number of operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the count of operations\n    count = 0\n\n    # If A is equal to B, no operations are needed\n    if A == B:\n        return count\n\n    # While A is not equal to B\n    while A!= B:\n        # If A is even, divide it by 2\n        if A % 2 == 0:\n            A = A // 2\n        # If A is odd, divide it by 2 and subtract 1\n        else:\n            A = (A - 1) // 2\n        # Increment the count of operations\n        count += 1\n\n        # If A is equal to 1, we need to multiply it by 2 until it reaches B\n        if A == 1:\n            # Calculate the number of multiplications needed\n            multiplications = 0\n            while A < B:\n                A = A * 2\n                multiplications += 1\n            # Add the number of multiplications to the count of operations\n            count += multiplications\n\n    return count\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Read the number of test cases"}]}
