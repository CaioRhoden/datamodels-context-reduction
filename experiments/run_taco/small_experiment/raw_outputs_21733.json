{"id": 21733, "input": "Lee was cleaning his house for the party when he found a messy string under the carpets. Now he'd like to make it clean accurately and in a stylish way...\n\nThe string $s$ he found is a binary string of length $n$ (i. e. string consists only of 0-s and 1-s).\n\nIn one move he can choose two consecutive characters $s_i$ and $s_{i+1}$, and if $s_i$ is 1 and $s_{i + 1}$ is 0, he can erase exactly one of them (he can choose which one to erase but he can't erase both characters simultaneously). The string shrinks after erasing.\n\nLee can make an arbitrary number of moves (possibly zero) and he'd like to make the string $s$ as clean as possible. He thinks for two different strings $x$ and $y$, the shorter string is cleaner, and if they are the same length, then the lexicographically smaller string is cleaner.\n\nNow you should answer $t$ test cases: for the $i$-th test case, print the cleanest possible string that Lee can get by doing some number of moves.\n\nSmall reminder: if we have two strings $x$ and $y$ of the same length then $x$ is lexicographically smaller than $y$ if there is a position $i$ such that $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 = y_2$,..., $x_{i - 1} = y_{i - 1}$ and $x_i < y_i$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. \n\nNext $2t$ lines contain test cases\u00a0\u2014 one per two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the string $s$.\n\nThe second line contains the binary string $s$. The string $s$ is a string of length $n$ which consists only of zeroes and ones.\n\nIt's guaranteed that sum of $n$ over test cases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $t$ answers\u00a0\u2014 one per test case.\n\nThe answer to the $i$-th test case is the cleanest string Lee can get after doing some number of moves (possibly zero).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n10\n0001111111\n4\n0101\n8\n11001101\n10\n1110000000\n1\n1\n\nOutput\n0001111111\n001\n01\n0\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, Lee can't perform any moves.\n\nIn the second test case, Lee should erase $s_2$.\n\nIn the third test case, Lee can make moves, for example, in the following order: 11001101\u00a0$\\rightarrow$ 1100101\u00a0$\\rightarrow$ 110101\u00a0$\\rightarrow$ 10101\u00a0$\\rightarrow$ 1101\u00a0$\\rightarrow$ 101\u00a0$\\rightarrow$ 01.\n", "difficulty": "EASY", "generations": [{"generated_text": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef clean_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a binary string as input and returns the cleanest possible string.\n    \n    The cleanest possible string is obtained by erasing all consecutive 1s followed by 0s and then sorting the remaining string in lexicographical order.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the clean string\n    clean = []\n    \n    # Initialize a flag to check if the previous character was 1\n    prev_was_1 = False\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # If the character is 1 and the previous character was not 1, add it to the clean string\n        if char == '1' and not prev_was_1:\n            clean.append(char)\n            prev_was_1 = True\n        # If the character is 0, add it to the clean string and reset the flag\n        elif char == '0':\n            clean.append(char)\n            prev_was_1 = False\n    \n    # Sort the clean string in lexicographical order\n    clean.sort()\n    \n    # Join the clean string into a single string and return it\n    return ''.join(clean)\n\n\n# Get the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\n\n# Iterate over each test case\nfor _ in range(t):\n    # Get the length of the string\n    n = int(input())\n"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem.\n\n```python\ndef clean_string(s):\n    # Remove consecutive 1s from the right\n    while s and s[-1] == '1':\n        s = s[:-1]\n\n    # Remove consecutive 0s from the left\n    while s and s[0] == '0':\n        s = s[1:]\n\n    return s\n\nt = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    clean_s = clean_string(s)\n    print(clean_s)\n```\n\nThis program works by first removing all consecutive 1s from the right of the string.
