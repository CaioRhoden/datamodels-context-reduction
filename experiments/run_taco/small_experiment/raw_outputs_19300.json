So the natural way to represent a permutation is\nto list the integers in this order. With n = 5, a\npermutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. \n\nHowever, there is another possibility of representing a permutation:\nYou create a list of numbers where the i-th number is the\nposition of the integer i in the permutation. \nLet us call this second\npossibility an inverse permutation. The inverse permutation\nfor the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nAn ambiguous permutation is a permutation which cannot be\ndistinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2\nfor example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same.\nTo get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a\nprogram which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.\n\n-----Input Specification-----\nThe input contains several test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n\n(1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000).\nThen a permutation of the integers 1 to n follows\nin the next line.

The `is_ambiguous` function takes two arguments: `n`, the number of elements in the permutation, and `permutation`, a list of integers representing the permutation.\n2. It first creates an inverse permutation by iterating over the original permutation and setting the `i-th` element of the inverse permutation to the position of the `i-th` element in the original permutation.\n3. It then iterates over the inverse permutation and checks if any of the elements are different from their corresponding elements in the original permutation. If it finds any differences, it returns \"not ambiguous\".\n4. If it doesn't find any differences, it returns \"ambiguous\".\n5. The `main` function reads the input from the user and calls the `is_ambiguous` function for each test case.\n6.
