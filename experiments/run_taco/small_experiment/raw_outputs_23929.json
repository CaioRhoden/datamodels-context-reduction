The function calculates the total number of steps by adding `a` and `b`. It then checks if the total number of steps is equal to the sum of `a` and `b`. If they are equal, it returns \"YES\", otherwise it returns \"NO\".\n\nWe then get the input from the user using the `input` function, split the input into two integers `a` and `b` using the `split` method, and map the input to integers using the `map` function. Finally, we call the `check_interval` function with `a` and `b` as arguments and print the result.\n\nThis program will output \"YES\" if there is an interval of steps from l-th to r-th for which values are correct, and \"NO\" otherwise."}]}
