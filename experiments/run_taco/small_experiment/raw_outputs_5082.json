The `backtrack` function is a recursive function that generates all possible valid IP addresses. It takes two parameters: `start`, which is the current position in the string, and `path`, which is the current IP address being constructed.\n\n4. If the length of the `path` is 4, it means we've constructed a complete IP address, so we add it to the `result` list.\n\n5. Otherwise, we try to append each possible number (from `start + 1` to `start + 4`, but not beyond the end of the string) to the `path` and recursively call `backtrack`.\n\n6.

The `restoreIpAddresses` function takes a string `s` as input and returns a tuple containing a list of all possible IP addresses and the count of possible IP addresses.\n\n2. The `is_valid_ip` function checks if a given part of an IP address is valid. It returns `True` if the part is a valid number between 0 and 255, and `False` otherwise.\n\n3. The `backtrack` function is a recursive function that generates all possible IP addresses. It takes a start index and a path as input, and checks all possible parts of the IP address starting from the start index.\n\n4. If the path has 4 parts, it checks if the start index is equal to the length of the input string. If it is, it means we have a complete IP address, so we add it to the result list.\n\n5. If the path has less than 4 parts, we check all possible parts of the IP address starting from the start index.
