We start a loop that continues until there are no more cards left in the deck (`n > 0`).\n3. In each iteration, we calculate the number of cards to deal to the current player (`deal = min(i, n)`). We use the minimum of `i` and `n` because we can't deal more cards than are left in the deck.\n4. We add the number of cards dealt to the current player's total (`alice += deal` or `bob += deal`).\n5. We subtract the number of cards dealt from the total number of cards left in the deck (`n -= deal`).\n6. We increment `i` by 1 to move on to the next step.\n7.
