We initialize the result and carry variables to store the final result and any carry from the addition.\n2. We initialize the pointers `i` and `j` to point to the last characters of the input strings `a` and `b`.\n3. We loop through the input strings from right to left until we've processed all the characters or there's no carry left.\n4. Inside the loop, we calculate the sum of the current bits and the carry. If the current bit is in `a`, we add its value to the sum. If the current bit is in `b`, we add its value to the sum.\n5. We update the result by prepending the least significant bit of the sum to the result string.\n6. We update the carry by dividing the sum by 2 and taking the integer part.\n7.
