Then it uses a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. Finally, it filters the elements with prime frequency greater than or equal to K and returns the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N*sqrt(N)) because we need to iterate over the array to create the frequency dictionary, and then we need to iterate over the dictionary to check if each frequency is prime. The space complexity is O(N) because we need to store the frequency of each element in the dictionary.\n\nNote: The `is_prime` function is not optimized for large numbers, as it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number. If you need to check large numbers, you may want to use a more efficient primality test."}]}
