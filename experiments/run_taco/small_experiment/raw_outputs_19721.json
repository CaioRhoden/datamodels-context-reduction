{"id": 19721, "input": "Anki started a new restaurant in Jalpaiguri. As a perfectionist, she wants no complaint from any of the customers.\nSo she decided to promise every customer with accurate time for waiting after the order is placed. Can you help Anki run her restaurant better by designing a program which will help her track the orders and hence calculate the accurate time?\nBut there is a problem. There are N types of dishes served there. For each item, the chef takes a certain time (varies from dish to dish) to prepare the dish and a stipulated time to rest after cooking it.\n\nNote: Each customer orders only one dish.\n\nInput format\nThe first line has a single integer T the number of test cases. Every test case comprises 4 lines.\nFirst line contains N, C and R the no of dishes, the number of customers and relaxation time of the chef in seconds respectively.\nNext line is followed by N integers signifying the preparation time for the i^th dish.\nNext line contains C integers signifying the dish each customer ordered.\nNext line contains the time of arrival of each customer in seconds considering the initial time to be 0. (i+1)^th customer does not arrive before i^th customer).\n\nNote: All arrays have been treated to be 1-indexed.\n\nOutput format\nDisplay C integers where each integer displays the time in seconds a customer has to wait for getting his dish cooked.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T, N, C, R \u2264 100\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n1\n3 4 1\n3 3 3\n3 2 1 3\n3 10 12 12\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n3 3 5 9\n", "difficulty": "EASY", "generations": [{"generated_text": "Here is a Python program that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_waiting_time():\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    t = int(input())\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        # Read the number of dishes, customers, and relaxation time\n        n, c, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n        # Read the preparation time for each dish\n        preparation_time = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Read the dish each customer ordered\n        customer_orders = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Read the time of arrival of each customer\n        customer_arrival_times = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Calculate the waiting time for each customer\n        waiting_times = []\n        for i in range(c):\n            # Calculate the total time taken to cook the dish\n            total_time = preparation_time[customer_orders[i] - 1] + r\n\n            # Calculate the waiting time\n            waiting_time = max(customer_arrival_times[i] + total_time - customer_arrival_times[0], 0)\n\n            # Add the waiting time to the list\n            waiting_times.append(waiting_time)\n\n        # Print the waiting times\n        print(*waiting_times)\n\n# Call the function\ncalculate_waiting_time()\n```\n\nThis program first reads the number of test cases.
