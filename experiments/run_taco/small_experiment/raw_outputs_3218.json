{"id": 3218, "input": "Read problems statements in [Hindi], [Mandarin Chinese], [Russian], [Vietnamese], and [Bengali] as well.\n\nChef has a memory machine. It has one layer for data storage and another layer for cache. Chef has stored an array with length $N$ in the first layer; let's denote its elements by $A_{0}, A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{N-1}$. Now he wants to load some elements of this array into the cache.\n\nThe machine loads the array in blocks with size $B$: $A_{0}, A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{B-1}$ form a block, $A_{B}, A_{B+1}, \\ldots, A_{2B-1}$ form another block, and so on. The last block may contain less than $B$ elements of Chef's array. The cache may only contain at most one block at a time. Whenever Chef tries to access an element $A_{i}$, the machine checks if the block where $A_{i}$ is located is already in the cache, and if it is not, loads this block into the cache layer, so that it can quickly access any data in it. However, as soon as Chef tries to access any element that is outside the block currently loaded in the cache, the block that was previously loaded into the cache is removed from the cache, since the machine loads a new block containing the element that is being accessed.\n\nChef has a sequence of elements $A_{x_{1}}, A_{x_{2}}, \\ldots, A_{x_{M}}$ which he wants to access, in this order. Initially, the cache is empty. Chef is wondering how many times the machine will need to load a block into the cache layer. Can you help him calculate this number?\n\n------  Input ------\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $B$ and $M$.\nThe second line contains $M$ space-separated integers $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{M}$.\n\n------  Output ------\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the number of times the machine loads a block into the cache.\n\n------  Constraints ------\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 100$\n$1 \u2264 N, B, M \u2264 5,000$\n$0 \u2264 x_{i} < N$ for each valid $i$\n\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \n1\n\n5 3 3\n\n0 3 4\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \n2\n----- explanation 1 ------ \nExample case 1: The machine stores elements $[A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2}]$ in one block and $[A_{3}, A_{4}]$ in another block. When accessing $A_{0}$, the block $[A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2}]$ is loaded. Then, accessing $A_{3}$ removes the previous block from the cache and loads the block $[A_{3}, A_{4}]$. Finally, when Chef accesses $A_{4}$, a new block is not loaded, since the block containing $A_{4}$ is currently loaded in the cache.\n", "difficulty": "EASY", "generations": [{"generated_text": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef load_blocks(N, B, M, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of times the machine needs to load a block into the cache layer.\n\n    Parameters:\n    N (int): The length of the array.\n    B (int): The size of each block.\n    M (int): The number of elements to access.\n    x (list): A list of elements to access.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of times the machine needs to load a block into the cache layer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the number of loads\n    loads = 0\n\n    # Initialize the current block\n    current_block = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the elements to access\n    for i in range(M):\n        # Calculate the block index of the current element\n        block_index = x[i] // B\n\n        # If the current block has changed, increment the number of loads\n        if block_index!= current_block:\n            loads += 1\n            current_block = block_index\n\n    # Return the total number of loads\n    return loads\n\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n\n# Iterate over the"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    N, B, M = map(int, input().split())\n    x = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    cache = set()\n    load = 0\n\n    for i in range(M):\n        if x[i] % B not in cache:\n            cache = set(range(x[i] // B * B, min(x[i] + 1, (x[i] // B + 1) * B)))\n            load += 1\n\n    print(load)\n\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    solve()\n```\n\nThis program works by iterating over the sequence of elements `x` and checking if the block containing the current element is already in the cache.

Then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `b`, and `m`, and the sequence of elements `x`. It then initializes a set `cache` to keep track of the blocks currently in the cache, and a variable `loads` to count the number of times a block is loaded into the cache.\n\nThe program then iterates over"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python program that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef load_blocks(n, b, m, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of times the machine loads a block into the cache layer.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The length of the array.\n    b (int): The block size.\n    m (int): The number of elements to access.\n    x (list): A list of indices to access.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The number of times the machine loads a block into the cache layer.\n    \"\"\"\n    cache = set()\n    loads = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        # If the current index is not in the cache, load the block\n        if x[i] % b!= 0 or x[i] // b not in cache:\n            loads += 1\n            cache = set(range(x[i] // b * b, min(x[i] + 1, (x[i] // b + 1) * b)))\n    \n    return loads\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    # Read the parameters\n    n, b, m = map(int,"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution to the problem:\n\n```python\ndef load_blocks(N, B, M, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of times the machine loads a block into the cache layer.\n\n    Args:\n    N (int): The length of the array.\n    B (int): The block size.\n    M (int): The number of elements to access.\n    x (list): A list of elements to access.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of times the machine loads a block into the cache layer.\n    \"\"\"\n    cache = set()\n    load_count = 0\n\n    for i in range(M):\n        # If the current element is not in the cache, load the corresponding block\n        if x[i] % B not in cache:\n            load_count += 1\n            cache = set(range(x[i] // B * B, min(x[i] // B * B + B, N)))\n\n    return load_count\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Read the input and print the output for each test case.\n    \"\"\"\n    T = int(input())  # Number of test cases\n\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, B, M = map(int, input()."}]}
