The `update_bit_tree` method updates the bit tree by inverting the bits in the specified range. The `query_bit_tree` method queries the bit tree to get the value of the bit at the specified index.\n\nThe `binary_simulation` method iterates over the queries and performs the corresponding operations on the binary string and the bit tree.

It uses a list to store the results of the 'Q' operations, which avoids the time-out issue. The 'I' operation is performed by inverting the bits from the specified range, and the 'Q' operation is performed by appending the result to the results list. If an 'I' operation is performed but its result is not asked, an empty list is returned."}]}
