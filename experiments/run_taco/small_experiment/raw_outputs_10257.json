{"id": 10257, "input": "# Right in the Center\n\n_This is inspired by one of Nick Parlante's exercises on the [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java) online code practice tool._\n\nGiven a sequence of characters, does `\"abc\"` appear in the CENTER of the sequence?\n\nThe sequence of characters could contain more than one `\"abc\"`.\n\nTo define CENTER, the number of characters in the sequence to the left and right of the \"abc\" (which is in the middle) must differ by at most one.\n\nIf it is in the CENTER, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\nWrite a function as the solution for this problem. This kata looks simple, but it might not be easy.\n\n## Example\n\n    is_in_middle(\"AAabcBB\")  ->  True\n    is_in_middle(\"AabcBB\")   ->  True\n    is_in_middle(\"AabcBBB\")  ->  False\ndef is_in_middle(s):\n\t", "difficulty": "EASY", "generations": [{"generated_text": "Here's a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_in_middle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the string \"abc\" appears in the center of the given sequence.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input sequence of characters.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if \"abc\" appears in the center, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(s) - 2):  # -2 because we're looking for \"abc\"\n        if s[i:i+3] == \"abc\":  # Check if the current substring is \"abc\"\n            left_count = sum(1 for j in range(i) if s[j]!='')\n            right_count = sum(1 for j in range(i+3, len(s)) if s[j]!='')\n            if abs(left_count - right_count) <= 1:\n                return True  # \"abc\" is in the center\n    return False  # \"abc\" is not in the center\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the input string `s` and checks each substring of length 3 to see if it's equal to \"abc\". If it finds a match, it counts the number of non-space characters to the left and right of the match. If the absolute difference between these counts is less than or equal to 1, it returns True, indicating that \"abc\" is in the center of the string. If it doesn't find any matches or none of them are in the center, it returns False.\n\nYou can test this function with the examples you provided:\n\n```python\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AAabcBB\"))  # -> True\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AabcBB\"))   # -> True\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AabcBBB\"))  # -> False\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here is the Python function that solves the problem:\n```python\ndef is_in_middle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the sequence \"abc\" appears in the CENTER of the given sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The sequence of characters to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if \"abc\" is in the CENTER, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    abc_index = s.find('abc')\n    if abc_index == -1:\n        # \"abc\" is not in the sequence\n        return False\n\n    left = s[:abc_index].count('a') + s[:abc_index].count('b') + s[:abc_index].count('c')\n    right = s[abc_index + 3:].count('a') + s[abc_index + 3:].count('b') + s[abc_index + 3:].count('c')\n\n    return abs(left - right) <= 1\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. We first find the index of the first occurrence of \"abc\" in the sequence using the `find` method.\n2. If \"abc\" is not found, we return `False`.\n3. We then calculate the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's to the left of \"abc\" by slicing the sequence up to the index of \"abc\" and counting the occurrences of each character.\n4. We do the same for the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's to the right of \"abc\" by slicing the sequence from the index of \"abc\" + 3 (since \"abc\" has 3 characters) to the end of the sequence.\n5. Finally, we return `True` if the absolute difference between the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's to the left and right of \"abc\" is less than or equal to 1, and `False` otherwise.\n\nYou can test this function with the examples you provided:\n```python\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AAabcBB\"))  # True\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AabcBB\"))   # True\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AabcBBB\"))  # False\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_in_middle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the sequence \"abc\" appears in the center of the given string.\n    \n    A sequence is considered to be in the center if the number of characters \n    to the left and right of the \"abc\" sequence differ by at most one.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if \"abc\" appears in the center of the string, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(s) - 2):  # Loop through the string, considering substrings of length 4\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"abc\":  # Check if the current substring is \"abc\"\n            # Calculate the number of characters to the left and right of \"abc\"\n            left = i\n            right = len(s) - i - 4\n            # Check if the difference between left and right is at most 1\n            if abs(left - right) <= 1:\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. We loop through the string, considering substrings of length 4 (since \"abc\" has a length of 3, we need to consider the character before and after \"abc\" as well).\n2. For each substring, we check if it's equal to \"abc\".\n3. If it is, we calculate the number of characters to the left and right of \"abc\".\n4. We check if the difference between the number of characters to the left and right is at most 1.\n5. If it is, we return True, indicating that \"abc\" appears in the center of the string.\n6. If we've checked all substrings and haven't found a match, we return False.\n\nYou can test the function with the examples you provided:\n\n```python\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AAabcBB\"))  # True\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AabcBB\"))   # True\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AabcBBB\"))  # False\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here is the Python solution for the problem:\n```python\ndef is_in_middle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the string \"abc\" appears in the center of the given sequence.\n    \n    Args:\n    s (str): The sequence of characters to check.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if \"abc\" is in the center, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Find the index of the first \"abc\" in the sequence\n    abc_index = s.find(\"abc\")\n    \n    # If \"abc\" is not found, return False\n    if abc_index == -1:\n        return False\n    \n    # Calculate the left and right distances to the \"abc\" substring\n    left_distance = abc_index\n    right_distance = len(s) - abc_index - 3  # Subtract 3 to account for the \"abc\" substring\n    \n    # Check if the distances differ by at most one\n    return abs(left_distance - right_distance) <= 1\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. We use the `find()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of \"abc\" in the sequence.\n2. If \"abc\" is not found, we return False.\n3. We calculate the left and right distances to the \"abc\" substring by subtracting the index from the start and end of the sequence, respectively.\n4. We check if the distances differ by at most one using the `abs()` function.\n\nYou can test the function with the examples you provided:\n```python\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AAabcBB\"))  # -> True\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AabcBB\"))   # -> True\nprint(is_in_middle(\"AabcBBB\"))  # -> False\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_in_middle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the string \"abc\" appears in the center of the given sequence of characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The sequence of characters to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if \"abc\" appears in the center, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find all occurrences of \"abc\" in the string\n    for i in range(len(s) - 2):\n        # Check if the current occurrence is in the center\n        if s[i:i+3] == \"abc\" and (i == 0 or s[:i].count(\"abc\") <= 1) and (i + 3 == len(s) or s[i+3:].count(\"abc\") <= 1):\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. We iterate over the string, checking each character to see if it's the first character of an \"abc\" sequence.\n2. If it is, we check if this \"abc\" sequence is in the center by checking the number of \"abc\" sequences to its left and right.\n3.

First, we use the `find` method to find the index of 'abc' in the string. If 'abc' is not found, `find` returns -1, and we return False.\n2. If 'abc' is found, we calculate the number of characters to the left and right of 'abc'. The left padding is the index of 'abc', and the right padding is the length of the string minus the index of 'abc' minus 3 (since 'abc' has 3 characters).\n3.

If it is, it then counts the characters to the left and right of \"abc\" and checks if they differ by at most one. If it finds a position where \"abc\" is in the center, it immediately returns True.
