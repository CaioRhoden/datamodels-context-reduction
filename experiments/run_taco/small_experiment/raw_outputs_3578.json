Iterate over the binary representation from right to left (i.e., from least significant bit to most significant bit).\n4.

This is known as the binary representation of `x`.\n\nTo find the minimum number of packets, we need to find the smallest number of powers of 2 that can sum up to `n`. This is equivalent to finding the smallest number of packets that can cover all amounts from 1 to `n`.\n\nWe use the formula `2^floor(log2(n)) + 1` to calculate this. This formula works by first calculating the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` (which is `2^floor(log2(n))`). We then add 1 to this value to account for the case where `n` is a power of 2.\n\nThe `math.log2(n)` function calculates the base-2 logarithm of `n`, and the `math.floor` function rounds this value down to the nearest integer. The `2 **` operator raises 2 to the power of this value.\n\nFinally, we return the result as the minimum number of packets required.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it involves a constant number of mathematical operations.
