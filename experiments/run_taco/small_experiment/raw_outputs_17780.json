The `count_ships` function takes the length `a` and width `b` of the original rectangular sheet of paper as input.\n2. The function uses a while loop to continuously fold the remaining strip of paper until a square piece is obtained.\n3. In each iteration, the number of ships is incremented by 1, and the length and width of the strip are updated.\n4. The function returns the total number of ships, including the last ship.\n5. The input is read from the user using the `input` function, and the number of ships is calculated and printed using the `count_ships` function."}]}
