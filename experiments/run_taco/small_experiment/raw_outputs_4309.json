Though Alfie was a witty and intelligent guy.He was confident of escaping prison.After few days of observation,He figured out that the prison consists of (N \u00d7 N) cells.i.e The shape of prison was (N \u00d7 N) matrix. Few of the cells of the prison contained motion detectors.So Alfie planned that while escaping the prison he will avoid those cells containing motion detectors.Yet before executing his plan,Alfie wants to know the total number of unique possible paths which he can take to escape the prison.Initially Alfie is in cell  \n(1,1) while the exit of the cell (N,N).  \n\nnote:->Alfie can move in all four direction{ if his current location is  (X,Y), he can move to either \n(X+1,Y), (X-1,Y), (X,Y+1), (X,Y-1) }. If the first cell (1,1) and the last cell(N,N) contain motion detectors,then Alfie can't break out of the prison.\n\nINPUT: \n\nThe first line contain number of test cases \"T\".T test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains an integer \"N\",(i.e the size of the (N \u00d7 N) matrix).The next n lines contain N space separated values either 0 or 1.\"1\" represents a cell containing motion detectors. \n\nOUTPUT: \n\noutput total number of unique possible paths which he can take to escape the prison.  \n\nConstraint:\n\n1 \u2264  T \u2264 20\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 20\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n3\n4\n0 1 1 0 \n0 0 1 0 \n0 0 0 0 \n0 1 1 0 \n4\n0 0 0 1 \n0 0 0 0 \n1 1 1 0 \n1 0 0 0 \n4\n0 1 1 0 \n0 0 1 1 \n0 0 0 0 \n0 1 0 0 \n \nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n2\n4\n4\n", "difficulty": "EASY", "generations": [{"generated_text": "To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming.

The `prison_escape` function takes a 2D list `matrix` as input and returns the total number of unique possible paths to escape.\n\nThe function initializes a 2D list `dp` of the same size as the input matrix. The value of `dp[i][j]` represents the total number of unique possible paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.\n\nThe function then initializes the first cell `dp[0][0]` to `1 - matrix[0][0]`, which represents the probability of not having a motion detector in the first cell.\n\nThe function then fills the rest of the `dp` table by iterating"}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python solution using Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization to solve the problem.\n\n```python\ndef dfs(i, j, n, grid, memo):\n    \"\"\"\n    Depth-First Search function to calculate the total number of unique paths.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    i (int): Current row index.\n    j (int): Current column index.\n    n (int): Size of the grid.\n    grid (list): 2D list representing the grid.\n    memo (dict): Dictionary to store the results of subproblems.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: Total number of unique paths.\n    \"\"\"\n    # If the current cell is out of bounds or is a motion detector, return 0.\n    if i < 0 or i >= n or j < 0 or j >= n or grid[i][j] == 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    # If the current cell is the destination cell, return 1.\n    if i == n - 1 and j == n - 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # If the subproblem has already been solved, return the stored result.\n    if (i, j) in memo:\n        return memo[(i, j)]\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of unique paths by recursively exploring all four directions.\n    total_paths = dfs(i - 1, j, n, grid, memo) + dfs(i + 1, j, n, grid, memo) + dfs(i, j - 1, n, grid, memo) + dfs(i, j + 1, n, grid, memo)\n    \n    # Store the result of the subproblem in the memo dictionary.\n    memo[(i, j)] = total_paths\n    \n    return total_paths\n\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem.\n    \n    Returns:\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    t = int(input())\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        grid = []\n        \n        # Read the grid.\n        for _ in range(n):\n            row = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            grid.append(row)\n        \n        # Initialize the memo dictionary.\n        memo = {}\n        \n        # Calculate and print the total number of unique paths.\n        print(dfs(0, 0, n, grid, memo))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_problem()\n```\n\nThis code defines a `dfs` function to perform the Depth-First Search with memoization.
