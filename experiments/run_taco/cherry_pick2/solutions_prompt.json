Given the probability of rainfall `P` and the travel time `T`, we want to find the probability that it rains during this time.\n\nWe can model this as a geometric distribution, where the probability of success (rainfall) is `P`, and the number of trials (minutes) is `T`. The probability of failure (no rainfall) in each trial is `(1 - P)`.\n\nWe can use the formula for the probability of rainfall during the travel time:\n\n`P(rainfall during travel) = 1 - (1 - P) ^ (T // 24) ^ 24`\n\nwhere `T // 24` represents the number of 24-minute blocks in the travel time, and `^ 24` represents the exponentiation of the probability of failure in each block.\n\nWe can implement this formula in the `calculate_probability` function, which takes the rainfall probability and travel time as input, and returns the calculated probability.\n\nIn the main part of the code, we get the number of test cases, process each test case, and print the result.\n\n**Sample Input and Output:**\n\n```\n2\n0 10\n0.5 720\n```"}, {"generated_text": "**Rainfall Probability Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis Python program calculates the probability that it rains during a certain time interval given a probability of rain.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_rainfall_probability(test_cases):\n    for _ in range(test_cases):\n        p, time = map(float, input().split())\n        if p == 0:\n            print(0.0000)\n        else:\n            # Calculate the probability of no rain during the entire journey\n            prob_no_rain = (1 - p) ** time\n            # Calculate the probability of rain during the journey\n            prob_rain = 1 - prob_no_rain\n            # Round the result to 4 decimal places\n            print(round(prob_rain, 4))\n\ndef main():\n    test_cases = int(input())\n    calculate_rainfall_probability(test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\nThis program takes the number of test cases as input and then for each test case, it takes two inputs: the probability of rain (`p`) and the time taken to reach the office (`time`). It then calculates the probability of rain during the journey by subtracting the probability of no rain from 1. If the probability of rain is 0, it prints 0.0000. Otherwise, it prints the probability of rain rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n*   Test case 1:\n    ```\n2\n0 10\n0.5 720\n```\n    Output: 0.0000\n*   Test case 2:\n    ```\n2\n0 10\n0.5 720\n```\n    Output: 0.2929\n\n**Constraints**\n----------------\n\n*   1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n*   0 \u2264 P \u2264 0.5\n*   10 \u2264 time \u2264 720\n*   time is a perfect divisor of 1440."}, {"generated_text": "Here is a Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_probability(rainfall_probability, travel_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the probability that it rains during the time Raj is on the way.\n\n    Args:\n    rainfall_probability (float): The probability that it will rain today.\n    travel_time (int): The time it will take for Raj to reach his office.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The probability that it rains during the time Raj is on the way.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the probability that it does not rain\n    no_rain_probability = 1 - rainfall_probability\n\n    # Calculate the probability that it rains during the travel time\n    rain_probability = (1 - math.pow(no_rain_probability, travel_time))\n\n    return round(rain_probability, 4)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\ntest_cases = int(input())\n\n# Process each test case\nfor _ in range(test_cases):\n    # Read the rainfall probability and travel time\n    rainfall_probability, travel_time = map(float, input().split())\n\n    # Calculate and print the result\n    print(calculate_probability(rainfall_probability, travel_time))\n```\n\nThis program works by first calculating the probability that it does not rain during the travel time, then using this value to calculate the probability that it rains during the travel time.
