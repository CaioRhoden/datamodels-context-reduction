It uses a for loop to process each test case. In each iteration, it reads the probability of rain and time from the input, calculates the fraction of the day that Raj will be on the way, and then calculates the probability of rain within the given time period. Finally, it rounds the answer to 4 decimal places and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\nTo use this code, simply copy and paste it into a Python file, and then run the file using Python (e.g., `python rain_probability.py`). The code will prompt you to enter the number of test cases, and then it will ask for the probability of rain and time for each test case. After you enter the input for all test cases, the code will print the result for each test case.\n\nFor example, if you enter the following input:\n```\n2\n0 10\n0.5 720\n```\nThe code will print the following output:\n```\n0.0000\n0.2929\n```"}, {"generated_text": "**Rainfall Probability Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis Python script calculates the probability that it rains during the time Raj is on the way to his office.\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_rainfall_probability(p, time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the probability that it rains during the time Raj is on the way.\n\n    Args:\n        p (float): Probability of rain today.\n        time (int): Time in minutes it takes for Raj to reach his office.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Probability that it rains during the time Raj is on the way.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_minutes = 1440  # Total minutes in a day\n    rainfall_minutes = total_minutes // time * time  # Minutes in a perfect divisor of 1440\n    return round(p * (rainfall_minutes / total_minutes), 4)\n\ndef main():\n    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases\n    for _ in range(t):\n        p, time = map(float, input().split())  # Probability of rain and time\n        print(calculate_rainfall_probability(p, time))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.
