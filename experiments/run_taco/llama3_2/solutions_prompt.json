the length `L` of the rectangle and the coordinates of the midpoints `p` and `q` of sides `AD` and `BC` respectively. \n\nWe can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of points `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints. \n\nSince `AD` and `BC` are equal, we can let their length be `L`. Then, the coordinates of the endpoints of `AD` can be `(-L/2, -L/2)` and `(L/2, -L/2)`, and the coordinates of the endpoints of `BC` can be `(-L/2, L/2)` and `(L/2, L/2)`.\n\nSo, the coordinates of points `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are:\n\n- `A`: `(-L/2, -L/2)`\n- `B`: `(L/2, -L/2)`\n- `C`: `(-L/2, L/2)`\n- `D`: `(L/2, L/2)`\n\nNow, we can express the coordinates of points `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` in terms of `p` and `q`:\n\n- `A`: `(-L/2, -L/2) = (p[0] - L/2, p[1] - L/2)`\n- `B`: `(L/2, -L/2) = (p[0] + L/2, p[1] - L/2)`\n- `C`: `(-L/2, L/2) = (p[0] - L/2, p[1] + L/2)`\n- `D`: `(L/2, L/2) = (p[0] + L/2, p[1] + L/2)`\n\nTherefore, we can express the coordinates of points `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` in terms of `p` and `q` as:\n\n```python\np1, p2 = p - L/2, p + L/2\nq1, q2 = q - L/2, q + L/2\n```\n\nFinally, we can return the coordinates of points `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` as a sorted list:\n\n```python\nreturn sorted([p1, p2, q1, q2])\n```"}, {"generated_text": "Here is the Python solution to the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n\n\tdef findCornerPoints(self, L, points):\n\t\tp = [points[0][0], points[0][1]]\n\t\tq = [points[1][0], points[1][1]]\n\t\treturn [[p[0]-L/2, p[1]-L/2], [p[0]-L/2, p[1]+L/2], [q[0]+L/2, p[1]+L/2], [q[0]+L/2, p[1]-L/2]]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe problem states that we are given the midpoints of sides AD and BC, along with the length L (AD = BC = L). We are asked to find the coordinates of the four points A, B, C, and D.\n\nWe can solve this problem by considering the midpoints as the average of the coordinates of A and D, and B and C, respectively.\n\nLet's denote the coordinates of A, B, C, and D as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), and (x4, y4), respectively.\n\nSince the midpoints are (p, q), we can write the following equations:\n\n(x1 + x4)/2 = p[0] - L/2 => x1 + x4 = 2 * (p[0] - L/2)\n(y1 + y4)/2 = p[1] - L/2 => y1 + y4 = 2 * (p[1] - L/2)\n(x2 + x3)/2 = q[0] + L/2 => x2 + x3 = 2 * (q[0] + L/2)\n(y2 + y3)/2 = q[1] + L/2 => y2 + y3 = 2 * (q[1] + L/2)\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nx1 = 2 * (p[0] - L/2) - x4\ny1 = 2 * (p[1] - L/2) - y4\nx2 = 2 * (q[0] + L/2) - x3\ny2 = 2 * (q[1] + L/2) - y3\n\nSubstituting these values into the original coordinates, we get:\n\nA = (2 * (p[0] - L/2) - x4, 2 * (p[1] - L/2) - y4)\nB = (2 * (p[0] - L/2), 2 * (p[1] - L/2) + y4)\nC = (2 * (q[0] + L/2), 2 * (q[1] + L/2) + y4)\nD = (2 * (q[0] + L/2) - x3, 2 * (q[1] + L/2) - y3)\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nA = [p[0]-L/2, p[1]-L/2]\nB = [p[0]-L/2, p[1]+L/2]\nC = [q[0]+L/2, p[1]+L/2]\nD = [q[0]+L/2, p[1]-L/2]\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n\n\tdef findCornerPoints(self, L, points):\n\t\tp = [points[0][0], points[0][1]]\n\t\tq = [points[1][0], points[1][1]]\n\t\treturn [[p[0]-L/2, p[1]-L/2], [p[0]-L/2, p[1]+L/2], [q[0]+L/2, p[1]+L/2], [q[0]+L/2, p[1]-L/2]]\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1)."}, {"generated_text": "Here's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n\n\tdef findCornerPoints(self, L, points):\n\t\tmid_x, mid_y = (points[0][0] + points[1][0]) / 2, (points[0][1] + points[1][1]) / 2\n\t\treturn sorted([(mid_x - L / 2, mid_y - L / 2), (mid_x + L / 2, mid_y - L / 2), (mid_x - L / 2, mid_y + L / 2), (mid_x + L / 2, mid_y + L / 2)])\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe solution is based on the fact that the midpoints of the diagonals of a rectangle coincide.

Since the given points `p` and `q` are the midpoints of the sides `AD` and `BC` of the rectangle, respectively, we can calculate the coordinates of the other two vertices `C` and `D` by using the midpoint formula.\n\nLet's assume the length of the sides `AD` and `BC` is `L`.

Since `p` is the midpoint of `AD`, we can calculate the coordinates of `A` as follows:\n\n`A = (x1 - L/2, y1 - L/2)`\n\nSimilarly, since `q` is the midpoint of `BC`, we can calculate the coordinates of `B` as follows:\n\n`B = (x2 + L/2, y2 + L/2)`\n\nFinally, we can return the coordinates of the 4 points in sorted order.\n\nTime Complexity: O(1)\n\nSpace Complexity: O(1)"}, {"generated_text": "Here is the solution to the problem:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findCornerPoints(self, L, points):\n        return sorted([self.getCornerPoints(L, points[0], points[1])])\n    \n    def getCornerPoints(self, L, p, q):\n        # calculate the distance between p and q\n        d = (q[0] - p[0]) ** 2 + (q[1] - p[1]) ** 2\n        \n        # calculate the x and y coordinates of the center\n        cx = (p[0] + q[0]) / 2\n        cy = (p[1] + q[1]) / 2\n        \n        # calculate the x and y coordinates of the corner points\n        ax, ay = cx - L / 2, cy - L / 2\n        bx, by = cx + L / 2, cy - L / 2\n        cx, cy = cx - L / 2, cy + L / 2\n        dx, dy = cx + L / 2, cy + L / 2\n        \n        return [(ax, ay), (bx, by), (cx, cy), (dx, dy)]\n```\n\nThis solution works by first calculating the distance between the two points `p` and `q`, which represents the length of the diagonal of the rectangle.
